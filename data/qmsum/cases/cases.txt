Summarize the discussion about the efficacy of the law.

Barry Hughes first stated that children had fewer rights than adults and therefore the law should be enforced to defend physical assault. As such social behavior was not available now, the law should change to reflect that. The discussion then turned to talk about the legal framework and its prosecution.

Barry Hughes thought that the law should reflect contemporary society and the law was evolutionary in nature. The criminal law provided a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. There was a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and there was a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. In that regard, it could be argued that children had fewer rights than adults. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, did provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault.

According to Barry Hughes, there is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and a child can't consent to assault. In respect of children in particular, they have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defense for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Barry Hughes think about the legal framework when talking about the efficacy of the law?

Barry thought that the legal framework would make things clearer for parents and professionals. But when it came to prosecuting, there was a degree of confusion and some cases were in the grey areas.

Barry Hughes thought the law should reflect contemporary society and the law was evolutionary in nature. The criminal law provided a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. There was a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provided for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. In that regard, it could be argued that children had fewer rights than adults. However, the fact that they might not have many prosecutions was not a reason not to say that they shouldn't signify that certain behaviour was or was not acceptable.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the two-stage test during prosecutions when discussing the efficacy of the law?

The first stage was to check whether there was sufficient evidence submitted by the police to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. Only if the first stage was satisfied, the second stage came to be considered, which was in the public interest.

Barry Hughes explained that when the police approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police, they apply the code for Crown prosecutors, which has a two-stage test. The first stage is whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is when the evidential stage is satisfied. If there isn't enough evidence, they don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because they wouldn't put an offence before the courts if they didn't think there was a realistic possibility of conviction.

The first stage was whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is whether the evidential stage is satisfied. If there isn't enough evidence, the police don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because they wouldn't put an offence before the courts if they didn't think there was a realistic possibility of conviction. If the defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS for a charging decision.

Summarize the discussion about the divergence between the law in England and Wales.

Barry Hughes indicated that the Bill would impact England and their people, although it needed a period. Moreover, Barry thought there was no cross-border issue from the potential legislation, and the draft changing to CPS guidance would not be helpful for scrutinisers to decide on the law in Wales.

Barry Hughes gave two examples of the divergence between the law in England and Wales. Firstly, there was an offence of putting an electronic collar on a pet. Secondly, there were other offences in Wales that didn't exist in England, but they didn't crop up very often. In terms of how they would approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, Barry Hughes believed that they would need to update the guidance, and it would go back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. There would be a further series of awareness raising.

According to Barry Hughes, there was a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and it was fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that was not available in Wales. In terms of how they would approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, the approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. The guidance would go back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage, and they would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that they were discussing here.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Barry Hughes think about the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales when talking about the divergence between the law in England and Wales?

Barry Hughes concluded two kinds of implications. First, the Bill would raise awareness for people from England who travel to Wales. Second, people in other areas might reflect on this defense as they did to the drink driving limit in Scotland.

Barry Hughes gave two examples. One was that the removal of the defense would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would in England, because the defence would still apply there. The second example was that they already had within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the CPS recognises this. There would be a different level of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it was fairly evident that there was a defence available in England that was not available in Wales.

Barry Hughes gave two examples: one of the implications was that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would in England, because the defence would still apply there. The second example was that they already had within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the example was this: drink driving. In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 µg in 100 ml of breath. In Wales, it is 22 µg.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Barry Hughes think about draft changes to CPS guidance when talking about the divergence between the law in England and Wales?

Barry Hughes thought draft changes to CPS guidance would not necessarily be helpful to the scrutinisers, and simply wanted to take the present interest factors. Barry thought they needed to work for the principles of generality and a degree of specificity.

Barry Hughes thought that there would be a clear record of any cases that were referred to the CPS from the police and that would be maintained by the police. However, he did not see a need to update the guidance, and it would go back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. There would be no change whatsoever to the burden of proof, nor to the standard of proof.

Barry Hughes thought that it would be better for them as scrutinisers of this Act if they could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before they made their final decision. In terms of how they would approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, his approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. What they would envisage was that they would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which were set out, in his view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that they were discussing here.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about out-of-court disposals.

Barry Hughes introduced their cooperated organizations the National Police Chiefs' Council and their work on the out-of-court disposals. Then, Hughes and Vikki Howells talked about the possibility of creating a body of out-of-court disposals specific to the Bill. Lastly, there was a short discussion about the duty around awareness raising.

Barry Hughes thought that there were a great many offences or reports of crime that did not reach the CPS because they were dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. There was a document called the director's guidance on charging, which was issued by the director of public prosecutions, which set out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. There would be cases where it was genuinely very difficult to assess what was the best approach, in which case they would have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case.

Barry Hughes explained that there were a great many offences or reports of crime that did not reach the CPS because they were dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. However, this was primarily a matter for the police, because there were no targets for securing convictions or not. There would be cases where it was genuinely very difficult to assess what was the best approach, in which case they would have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case.

==================================================
==================================================
How did the National Police Chiefs' Council help in out-of-court disposals?

The National Police Chiefs' Council was responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals.

The National Police Chiefs' Council had been working with deputy chief constable Sara Glen. She was responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of disposals. There was quite a range and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved.

The National Police Chiefs' Council was responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals. They would keep a manual log of every referral. Offences that the police referred to them for a charging decision would generally be offences where the police felt that there should be a prosecution rather than an out of court disposal.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Barry Hughes think about the infrastructure of out-of-court disposals?

Barry Hughes thought that the infrastructure can be built for a range of out-of-court disposals. It might be built by the Welsh Government, the police, and crime commissioners.

The way Barry Hughes saw it was that, within Wales, there could build an infrastructure that provided for a range of out-of-court disposals. The police and crime commissioners could use some of their commissioning powers to work something up. It would need to be developed.

The way Barry Hughes saw it was that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about unintended consequences.

Barry Hughes explained a number of unintended consequences questioned. The first one was about the isolated incidences in Wales, and the second came to the targets in terms of performance measure. The following concerns included malicious reporting, the European convention on human rights, low numbers of prosecutions, and a shortage of registered intermediaries.

Sian Gwenllian AM suggested that under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who couldn't use the reasonable punishment defense was convicted of assaulting their child, then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that would inevitably have an impact upon their life prospects. Barry Hughes answered that this was unlikely to happen, because they already had a well-developed approach to dealing with the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they wanted to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication.

Sian Gwenllian AM asked Barry Hughes about the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. Barry Hughes answered that there was no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England was being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that applied in Wales.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Barry Hughes think about the targets regarding performance measure?

Barry Hughes stated that they did not have targets and only prosecuted with reasonable prospects. As for the police, there were no targets for the police anymore, except for some individuals.

Barry Hughes thought that the numbers were likely to be very small, and any assertion of looking to meet targets would be a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean. In the CPS, we don't have targets for securing convictions or not. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets.

Barry Hughes thought that the numbers were likely to be very small, for the reasons they had explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest. Any assertion of looking to meet targets would be a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Karen Cornish think about a shortage of registered intermediaries?

Karen Cornish thought it was a potential barrier but not a substantial barrier. The Ministry of Justice had taken action to deal with it and there had had a number of people in the positions. However, it was true that the work required larger recruitment.

According to Barry Hughes, there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and the Ministry of Justice had taken action to deal with that, and they had had a number of people who were now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, they may have a problem, but in turn, they would be looking to recruit more people into those positions.

Summarize the discussion about evaluation criteria of remote control.

The group thought the remote control should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria. Although they had brilliant ideas and designed a best remote control within their capacity, they just designed a product of high quality but low acceptance.

Industrial Designer thought it was fancy because it was spongy, easy to use and easy to learn. User Interface thought it had a good look and feel and was easy to program. Project Manager thought the product was innovative because it had the voice recognition function and the scroll wheel. However, it was not good enough for the high-tech market because it didn't offer voice recognition and it was hard for novice users to learn to use. Marketing thought it would be hard for advanced users to use because voice recognition was not for the elderly and advanced users would not use it.

Industrial Designer thought the remote control was fancy with fancy look and feel. Project Manager thought it was not fancy high-tech because it lacked the features of a normal remote control. However, Industrial Designer thought it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case, but they decided not to use it because it would be too expensive. Marketing thought the product was spongy and easy to use, but the advanced users would like to explore all additional functions.

==================================================
==================================================
Did the group think the remote control was easy to use when discussing evaluation criteria of the remote control?

User Interface believed that voice recognition was hard to learn while Industrial Designer argued that the remote control had two parts and everyone could use the basic part. He also pointed out that an advanced user would like to explore additional functions.

Industrial Designer thought the remote control was easy to use for novice users because it was spongy and easy to program. User Interface thought the voice recognition function was hard to learn because novice users needed to understand what to change channels and change the volume, so it was not for the elderly. Marketing thought the most important function of zapping, channel switching, volume, and mute was easy, but advanced functions were probably a bit harder. Project Manager thought it was a two out of three.

Industrial Designer thought the remote control was easy to use for novice users, but advanced users would like to explore all the additional functions. Project Manager was not sure about the ease of use because it only applied to the most basic functions, such as zapping, channel switching, volume.

==================================================
==================================================
Did the group think the remote control was competitive in the discussion of evaluation criteria of the remote control?

Marketing thought that the basic layout was mundane but the voice recognition was brilliant. User Interface added that it did not have the digits but had all the features a normal remote control had. Industrial Designer agreed but pointed out that they just design the best product within their capacity. Project agreed and concluded that it was of high quality but low acceptance.

Industrial Designer thought the remote control offered enough features and was easy to use. Project Manager thought it was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality. User Interface thought the product was fancy and spongy. Marketing thought it had a good look and feel, but the voice recognition function was hard to learn and was not for the elderly.

Industrial Designer thought the remote control was innovative because it could add a lot of functionality by using the voice recognition mode. Project Manager thought it was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality because a regular programmable remote control contains at least forty buttons.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group discuss about production costs of the product?

Project Manager revealed that it would cost 22 Euros at current standards so they should leave out some characteristics that could not add much value. Since it could be dull and simple without those characteristics, the group supposed that the selling price could be raised to 50 Euros.

The group agreed that the selling price of the product would be 25 Euros, which was above the original price of 50 Euros. However, they could not exceed the production cost of 12.5 Euros because the solar cell was very expensive, so they decided to skip it. The group also agreed to not use the voice recognition function because it was not that important.

Industrial Designer first pointed out that an original remote control of any TV kind, a Phillips remote control, was more than fifty Euros, which was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality. However, Project Manager reminded the group that they were paying for the brand, because there were remote controls which control stereo, television, D-V-D, C-D player for under twenty five Euros. Then, the group discussed the cost of the solar cell. The cost was four Euros and it was a four Euro addition to the price.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group think about the reduction of production costs?

Project Manager revealed that it would be over budget so they had to make some changes. He proposed to reduce costs by leaving out solar cells and not using voice recognition. Then User Interface supposed that the buttons could be made of plastics and Industrial Designer proposed to make the remote control straight and simple.

The group agreed that the process was good and that the product was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality. However, they were not aware of the prices of the costs. Therefore, they decided to skip the solar cell and not use the voice recognition feature.

Industrial Designer thought that the product was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality. Project Manager pointed out that an original remote control of any TV kind, a Phillips remote control, was more than fifty Euros and it costed hundred Gilders. So the group agreed that it was not too expensive for the product.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Industrial Designer propose in the discussion of production costs?

Since the prototype was over budget, Industrial Designer proposed to raise the selling price to 50 Euros. He thought it was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality.

Industrial Designer proposed that the selling price of the remote control should be 25 Euros, which was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality. However, it was tempered by the choice of components and the price. Therefore, Industrial Designer suggested that the team should consider changing the casing to reduce the cost.

Industrial Designer pointed out that the original remote control of any TV kind, a Phillips remote control, was more than fifty Euros, which was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality. However, there were remote controls which controlled stereo, television, D-V-D, C-D player for under twenty five Euros.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group discuss the functional design on the remote control?

Project Manager stated the meeting topic on function design. Firstly, Marketing concluded a study on user needs, including buttons for channel selection according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each button, and suggested targeting on the nineteen to thirty-five years old age group to design functions. Next, User Interface presented on the technical effect on what functions users need and how to make the best functions for users. Then, Industrial Designer presented the working design, including input a channel or volume setting and output the location function to the television.

User Interface first gave a presentation about the technical functions design of the remote control, focusing on the basic functions such as turning on and off the TV, channel selection, teletext, volume, power, and location function. Then, Industrial Designer gave an overview of the working design and incorporated ideas from the last meeting. User Interface suggested that the remote should be made in a user-friendly and fashionable way, keeping buttons together that were used in the same colour, keeping the number of buttons to a minimum, and also making it fashionable. The group then discussed the location function and decided to have a buzzer on the TV to send out a signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate to tell the user where the remote was.

The group discussed the functional design of the remote control. First, they discussed the basic functions such as turning on and off the TV, turning channels, changing the volume and setting the menu. Then, they talked about the location function where the user could press a button on the TV and it would send a signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell the user where the remote was. They also discussed the number of buttons and the shape of the buttons. The group agreed that the buttons should be made in the same colour as the remote and they should be fashionable.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group discuss the finder button and call button?

At the first beginning of the discussion, Industrial Designer mentioned that it would be easy to implement something like a buzzer to trace the remote location. Project Manager suggested a two-part package - on one hand, users could click the button on the TV to send out the signal; on the other hand, the remote base could beep probably so that users could know where the remote control has gone.

Industrial Designer thought that a beep was the most reasonable to implement because it would send out a signal and the remote would receive the signal and it would beep when it was in line of sight, so unless the remote was actually in front of the TV, it would not work. User Interface thought that the buzzer would be easy to implement. Project Manager thought that it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you had to find the remote first to click the button and then it would start ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever. Marketing thought that if the TV was on it's making sound and the people on the TV were talking, then the TV's gonna switch itself to channel one, so if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light.

Industrial Designer suggested that the finder button could be put on the TV or on a wall or some place since the TV already had power. User Interface suggested that it could be on the remote itself so that users could find it. Project Manager agreed and asked Industrial Designer to design a separate base for that.

==================================================
==================================================
What did group members think of the speech recognition design suggested by Marketing?

Marketing suggested the speech recognition design is for user groups aged from nineteen to thirty-five. Industrial Designer supplemented the feature design that if the TV is on and somebody says like one, then the TV would switch itself to channel one. However, Project Manager illustrated that considering the budget, to have the speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be expensive. And this ended up was commonly agreed by other group mates.

Marketing suggested that they could have a buzzer on the TV or on the wall or some place since the TV already had power. The buzzer would send out a signal and if somebody said one, then the TV would switch itself to channel one. However, this idea was challenged by Industrial Designer, who pointed out that speech recognition was really hard to programme.

Marketing suggested that the buzzer could be on the TV itself and if the TV was making sound and the people were talking, then the TV would switch itself to channel one. Project Manager thought this idea was a little bit silly. Industrial Designer thought it was easy to implement. User Interface thought it would be a two-part package.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about the VCR / VHR / DVD capability button.

Project Manager mentioned that the group needed to decide on the VCR capabilities and answered Industrial Designer's question on whether VCRs were the same across the world. So Industrial Designer suggested a whole different set of buttons for individual VCRs. Project Manager suggested DVD type if considering the target group as young professionals and teenagers.

User Interface thought that it would make sense to have a function switch button, so that users could switch to a function where they were either on TV, on DVR, or on VCR. However, Industrial Designer thought it would be hard to implement because there would be a lot of buttons on the remote, so they would need to design a separate base for that. Project Manager thought that they could just design the channel changers and the power button separately.

The team agreed that the VCR / VHR / DVD capability button should be a function switch button, so that users could switch channels and change the function of the little circle disc by pressing it. However, the team did not agree on whether VCR/VHR/DVD capability buttons were the same across international, as they would need a whole different set of buttons for everybody's VCRs.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about microphone issues

The professor pointed out that the lapel microphones were too close, so they were not good representative microphones. There was strong agreement that mics capture breath and other non-voice sounds since they were common.

The team thought that the lapel was a good choice because it was in the middle of the recording, but the team was concerned that it would not get rid of all the noise. The team also wanted to know if there was a way to reduce the amount of noise and noise that was causing the problem. The professor suggested that the team could look into spectral subtraction and on-line normalization.

The team thought that the lapel was a good choice because it was in the middle. However, the team also wanted to make sure that the microphone they were using was not too hot or too cold. The team also discussed how they could improve the performance of the microphone by adding spectral subtraction and on-line normalization.

==================================================
==================================================
What did PhD F think about computational resources?

PhD F explained that he mistakenly had run his tasks on all the available compute instances. There was not enough computational resources going around. New computers were coming soon, but people would have to learn to share until then. It was important not to saturate computational resources. He also told the team how to properly queue tasks.

PhD F informed the team that they had ordered twelve new machines to use as a compute farm. The SRI recognizer had all this P-make customs stuff built into it and they were using all the machines. PhD F wanted to make sure that they did not saturate the network with too many jobs at once.

PhD F informed the team that they had ordered twelve new machines to use as a compute farm. PhD F explained that they were running P-make and Customs here and Andreas had got a number of little utilities that made it very easy to run things using P- make and Customs.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the professor say about the workshop?

The professor recalled that at a workshop at Hopkins or Rutgers, twenty-five participants were running their tasks on twenty-five machines. Things would have been better if they ran tasks on their own machine. He was adding to PhD F's remarks on students in the team doing a similar thing.

The professor mentioned that Sunil was here for the summer for the first time and that the team was working on a kick off meeting, a kick-off meeting for the Aurora project, and plans for where they would go between now and then. The professor also mentioned that they were looking at ways to combine one form or another of noise removal with a neural network to improve the performance of the model. The team was also trying to figure out how to make the model more robust to different kinds of noise.

The professor informed the team that Sunil was in town for the summer and that they would have a kick-off meeting, a progress report, and plans for where they went between now and then. He also informed them that the team would be getting a repository for their data. The professor also shared some of the work that they had been doing in the last few weeks. The team had been working on spectral subtraction, on-line normalization, and switching between the Switchboard recognizer and the Cepstrum coefficient.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about spectral subtraction

The team was doing spectral subtraction with both scaling and GGT bins. There were pros and cons to both approaches. The professor suggested a simple spectral subtraction followed by a KL transformation. He also suggested using JRASTRA's technique which relied on adding some noise to get rid of noise. The team also suggested VTS techniques.

The team was playing around with spectral subtraction on the signal subspace. The team was trying to figure out whether it was better to do it on FFT bins or on the CMU system. The professor thought that it would be better if they did it on the FFT, but the team was not sure if that would work for large vocabulary tasks. They were also trying to find an optimum for the model.

PhD A informed the team that the signal subspace approach had actually an in-built Wiener filtering in it. The difference was that they were taking the actual France Telecom features and then applying something to

==================================================
==================================================
What did the team say about the person in Grenada?

PhD D brought up a VTS technique to do voice-unvoice which was developed by Jose Carlos Segura, who is a person from Grenada. The professor did not know him, but the inspiration for the VTS had come from CMU.

The professor informed the team that there was one person in Grenada working in the cepstral domain who was working on a VTS and another in Lucent that he had met at ICASSP. The professor did not know who the person was.

The professor informed the team that there was a person in Grenada who was working in the cepstral domain. He was a professor at CMU. The professor asked the team if they knew him. The team did not know him.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the professor think about the Wiener filter?

The professor could not see the advantage in combining the Wiener filter and the subspace. He later understood it would be a simple spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform, followed by a Wiener filter.

The professor thought that the Wiener filter did not work very well if the SNR was very bad. He suggested that the team could combine spectral subtraction with signal subspace to improve SNR. The professor also suggested that they could combine the two approaches.

The professor explained that the signal subspace approach had an in-built Wiener filter. The professor thought that the advantage of combining two things was mainly coming from the signal-subspace approach. He thought that if they had to use simple spectral subtraction, they may have to do some optimization.

==================================================
==================================================
What were the topics talked about in the meeting?

The group discussed recording equipment issues, including the purchase of two additional headsets and the prospect of getting a new base station and a set of wireless microphones to replace those wired microphones currently in use. Speaker fe008 presented the current status on transcriptions, and explained procedures for cleaning up transcripts and ensuring they conform with set conventions. Speaker mn014 briefly described his efforts to normalize loudness levels across speech channels to distinguish between foreground and background speech. Finally, the group discussed legal and procedural issues concerning the provision of transcripts to meeting participants for 'bleeping out' any sections of speech they want excluded from the Meeting Recorder database.

The meeting was mainly focused on the recording and transcription of the data. The team discussed how they were going to get people to edit bleeps out of the transcripts and how to ensure that the data were not accidentally bleeped out. They also discussed whether they should get another wireless setup, which was cheaper than the wired setup, and whether they could replace the wired mikes with wireless ones. They were also concerned about how they could ensure that their transcripts were not affected by bleeps.

The meeting was primarily about the progress of recording, transcription, and bleep editing. First, the team discussed the status of the microphones and channels, and how they could improve the quality of the recordings. The team also discussed whether they should get another wireless setup and how many channels they could have in a wireless setup. Second, they discussed how to handle bleeps in the transcripts and how to ensure that they are not accidentally bleeped out.

==================================================
==================================================
What was said about the equipment?

The group discussed recording equipment issues, including the purchase of two additional headsets and the prospect of getting a new base station and a set of wireless microphones to replace those wired microphones currently in use.

The team was working on a new multi-channel audio recording system, which was running on a HMM base with six wireless mikes, possibility of six wireless receivers, and a wireless receiver. The team was also working on changing the headsets, which would require some hand-soldering or hand-sealing, and changing the connector on a wired mike.

The team is working on getting the microphone and other equipment ready for the recording phase. The team is replacing the wired mikes with wireless. The cost of the equipment is nine hundred dollars for the base station and eight hundred per channel for the wireless, which is expensive, but it does seem to be better than the wired.

What did the team say about recording conventions?

Efforts will be made to ensure that recording conventions are consistent across ICSI, the University of Washington, and SRI.

The team agreed that they would incorporate additional conventions that Liz requested in terms of having a systematic handling of numbers and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about. For example, numbers would be separated in space and the letters would be placed in parentheses to indicate what type of comment they were. The team also agreed that there would be some differences in commas.

The team agreed that they should incorporate additional conventions that Liz had requested in terms of having a systematic handling of numbers, acronyms which they hadn't been specific about. They should also include bleeps in the transcriptions to ensure that they are not accidentally bleeped out.

==================================================
==================================================
What’s the current state of transcriptions?

Approximately 32-35 hours of meeting data have been recorded, roughly 30 hours of which comprise non-digits recordings. The transcribers have begun performing digit extraction (see abstract for Bmr013) and should be finished within a few days. Approximately 11 hours of speech have been transcribed.

Transcribers have transcribed about thirty-two hours of data so far. The next step is to ensure that the data are clean first, and then channelized.

Transcribers have transcribed about thirty-two hours of data as of a week ago, so they have about eleven hours that are finished transcribing from them. The next step is to ensure that the data are clean first, and then channelized.

==================================================
==================================================
What was needed for the transcripts?

Efforts by speaker fe008 are in progress to ensure that transcripts are clean (i.e. spell checked), channelized, and conform to set conventions regarding the coding of numbers, acronyms, and explicit comments (e.g. door slams, coughs, and laughter). Subsequent efforts by speaker fe008 will be to tighten up boundaries on the time bins. Inter-annotator agreement was reported to be very good. Speaker mn014's multi-channel speech/non-speech segmenter is in use.

Transcribers would have to generate web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted to see if they could bleep out sections they didn't want to hear. They would also have to ensure that the data are clean first, and then channelized.

Transcribers will generate web pages with the transcription in it so that participants can click on them and piece pieces and read them, and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded.

Summarize the discussion about value for user and situation models.

First, Grad E proposed a question about better discriminating the definition of user and situation models, and it was necessary to set values for the models. Then, they discussed the issues in terms of the user's running budget, which was vital for the outcome of decisions. They tried to design a set of terms to describe the user's financial policy, such as thrift, average, spendy, or more finer scale ones.

The team thought that the user's budget may influence the outcome of decisions, but they needed to make sure that the decision about whether or not to enter the castle was based on whether the user wanted to go there or not. They also wanted to know if the user was going to view the castle when it was open or not, and whether it was a good time to enter. The professor suggested that they could have a "fit" node that was a measure of the match between the object and the entity.

The team discussed how the user's budget may influence the outcome of decisions. The professor suggested that the user could only enter a place if they are not too tired to do so and also have the money to do it if it costs something, whereas if they can afford it and perform it, then they are more likely to enter. The team also discussed whether the time of day affects the likelihood of entering a place.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group members think of the value of user budget when discussing value for user and situation models?

The reason why they mentioned user budget was that they wanted to take this example to further discuss the value for user model. Also, user budget was an important factor for the outcomes of decisions. Then, they tried to decide which set of words could represent the budget better. Finally, they found that the words that could describe financial policy of users, such as user thrift, was appropriate.

The group members thought that the user's budget may influence the outcome of decisions, but they needed to figure out how much money they had left to spend and when they would need to enter the building. The professor suggested that they could have a fit node that was a measure of the match between the object's feature and the user, but that would have to be computed by someone else.

The group thought that the user budget was different from the financial policy a person carries out in his life. The user budget could be thought of as a number that represents how much money they have left to spend. The group agreed that if it was an expensive place to enter, this would affect the likelihood of entering.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about Go-there decision.

Grad E proposed the idea that Go-there decision was also worth thinking about. Professor B suggested that the decision could stick to the discourse properties as a placeholder. With regard to the lack of ontologies, Professor B thought that it could use the same properties like exhibiting and selling. Grad E doubted the choice of binary EVA values, but Professor B insisted that it was still necessary to make this choice. Then the group members discussed the layout of belief-nets, for example, the connection between Go-there nodes and other ones such as endpoints. And Professor B reminded me that the belief-nets should not have loops.

Grad E thought that the decision would be about whether to go there in the first place or not. The professor thought that it might not be true or false because they did not have an idea of when it would be the most appropriate time to enter the castle. Grad E suggested that they could have an intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go-there S node sort of fed into each other.

Grad E suggested that the Go-there decision would have a node from discourse, and the endpoint would be fed by separate ones. The professor agreed and suggested that they could have an intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Grad E say when discussing Go-there decision?

Grad E first started the topic about Go-there decision, and then proposed the question about how to represent discourse. Though Professor B insisted on using true-and-false values, Grad E challenged Professor B's opinion by taking examples about whether people really wanted to go some place or not when they asked how to get there.

Grad E thought that the decision would be about whether the person wanted to go there or not. Grad E suggested that they could have two different things, Go-there and then the possibilities of how they go there. The latter would be binary and given that you're going there when it's open, you're more likely to enter. The former would be true or false.

Grad E suggested that the Go-there decision would have a node from discourse, and the endpoint would be fed by separate nodes. Grad E also suggested that they could have an intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about probability computation.

Professor B first emphasized the necessity of combining influences mathematically and asked Grad D to further explain the potential solutions. Then the students discussed the computation methods including weighted combination and mixture of experts, based on the mechanism of belief-nets. But there was no consensus on which method should be applied in belief-nets.

The group discussed the basic design of what influences what done before they decide exactly how to compute it. The first step was to specify the conditional property of each node given its parents. The second was to find a principled way of saying what each of these is and how to get it to add up to one. The third was to get a weighted average of the probabilities of each of the decision nodes.

The group discussed the basic properties of the belief-net and the probabilities of each decision. The probability of being E is one over four, the probability of E equals A, and the probability that Y equals one is two over four. The probabilities of being a landmark or a place of business are given as probabilities. The group discussed how to specify the conditional property of this given all those properties. They wanted the probabilities to add up to one.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Grad D say about mixture of experts when discussing probability computation?

Grad D first said that different experts were reliable in different situations and it was necessary to organically combine them to make the network adapt to diverse situations. The network could be divided into several parts and the network would decide which of the experts would be trusted in this particular situation. Grad D then answered other group members' questions about the layout of mixture of expert models and their detailed computation process.

Grad D said that the way to deal with the problem was to have a mixture of experts. The way to do this was to view each of these as experts who were making a decision based on some factors and then combine their decisions and create a weighted combination. The H node looked at these four values of those guys and decided which of these was likely to be more reliable or most reliable.

Grad D explained that a belief-net has a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node. In order for the probability to add up to one, the W's sum must be one. Each of the experts is making a decision based on some factors and the weighted combination of their outputs combined to make a decision.

==================================================
Summarize the discussion about product requirements.

Based on the presentations of the user interface designer, the industrial designer and the marketing expert which were about the product requirements, the project manager concluded that the new remote control should be powerful, easy to use, fashionable, recognizable and only for television. Furthermore, the remote control should use the Internet rather than teletext due to the spread of the Internet.

Firstly, the group agreed that the colour of the product should be yellow and the image of the society should be recognised in the product, such as the colour and slogan. Secondly, the remote control should only be used for television, so it would be easier for the user to design it. Thirdly, it should be simple and easy to use, so that it would not take too much time to learn how to use.

Firstly, Project Manager announced that the remote control would only be used for television, so users would not need buttons to manipulate the recorder or to control the TV. Secondly, they wanted the colour of the product to be yellow, and the slogan to be recognisable in the product. Thirdly, they didn't want to have too many buttons because seventy five percent of users zapped a lot, so maybe just having many functions in one button was not that good if users wanted to zap a lot. Finally, they agreed that they should have a balance between function and the cost.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the user interface designer and the industrial designer recommend to do when discussing the product requirement and why?

The user interface designer recommended to design a Google TV controller because Google was very successful for its powerful functions and friendly user interface. Also, to make the customers able to use the product without learning the manual, the industrial designer suggested applying some international standards such as some pictograms.

The user interface designer and the industrial designer recommended to design a fashion remote control which would be fashionable, powerful and easy to use. They also suggested to have a switch menu so that users could select which colour they preferred and make it look fancy.

The user interface designer proposed to design a fancy, powerful and easy to use remote control. The industrial designer suggested to have many colours of the remote control instead of one grey standard.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about the Internet connection.

The industrial designer expressed concern about how to connect TV to the Internet and the user interface designer said a set box would enable TV to surf the Internet. However, the technology was not very popular, which might be an obstacle for global usage of the product.

The remote control would be able to connect to the TV with a box in the TV, so with the set box you could connect internet with your TV. However, Industrial Designer thought that it would not be part of the remote control design. Project Manager thought it would be better if people didn't have the technology to use the Internet because it was not so popular now.

Industrial Designer thought that it was not necessary for the remote control to connect to the Internet. Project Manager thought it would be better if people didn't have the technology. User Interface thought it was more in browsing.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about the industrial design of the product.

The group reached the agreement to design an infrared-based controller because it was cheaper than a laser. Secondly, the industrial designer preferred a wireless remote control as it was easier to manage but the suggestion was doubted by the marketing and the project manager considering the cost and user requirements. Another thing was about the buttons. The marketing advised having less buttons because only ten percent of the buttons were actually in use and people tended to zap a lot.

Industrial Designer first gave an industrial design of the remote control. The remote control would be made of leather based and the system would be a bulb and an infrared bulb. The bulb would be somewhere inside and the bulbs would be in between the electrical device and the electronic device. The infrared would be cheaper and it would be less technology than the conventional one. It would be easier to manage and take less time for user to learn how to use it.

The Industrial Designer first gave an industrial design of the remote control. The remote control would be made of leather and the system inside it would consist of a bulb and an infrared bulb. The bulb would be blue and the infrared would be red. For the cheap price they had, the infrared was better to control TV because it was less technology than the laser.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the project manager disagree with the industrial designer when talking about whether to have a wireless control?

Firstly, the industrial designer said the wireless technology would cost 8 Euros which was higher than the manager's expectation. Secondly, whether the users would like to have a wireless control or not was unknown and the marketing would go to figure it out. Finally, having a link between the remote control and the television would prevent control from losing.

The project manager thought that a cable between the remote control and the TV would be a good idea, but he didn't think that a wireless remote control would be too much of a cost-prohibitive. He thought that the wireless problem was more David Jordan's problem.

The industrial designer thought that it would be feasible to have a link between the remote control and the television. However, the project manager thought that the wireless problem was more the David Jordan's problem.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the user interface designer recommend to do when discussing the problem of having less buttons?

The industrial designer recommended mixing several functions in one button by having a switch menu. For example, the category the functions into several classes and link switch menu to this kind of this category of functions.

The user interface designer recommended to have a switch menu, so that users could mix several functions in one button. It would be easier for the user to learn how to use the remote control and take less time for users to learn to use it.

The user interface designer suggested that they could have a switch menu, which would allow them to mix several functions in one button. For example, if there's a button to switch between control TV and control the recorder, they can have less buttons. However, he was not so sure about how to make the remote control look fancy.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about product appearance.

Based on earlier experiments and questionnaires, the marketing found that seventy-five percent of the users thought most remote controls ugly. Thus, the group decided to make the product look fancy so that people would pay more. However, how to make remote control look fancy was a big problem because different people have different opinions about fancy. What's more, the project manager thought the product should be recognizable and attractive.

The team agreed that the colour of the product should be yellow and the slogan should be recognized as the image of the society. The team also agreed that it should be attractive and not too many buttons should be on the remote control.

The team agreed that the product should be fancy, fashion, powerful and easy to use. The team also agreed that it should not be too many buttons because seventy five percent of users zapped a lot, so they were using the device intensively. Also, the team wanted the product to be attractive.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the opinion of the user interface designer and the industrial designer towards the product appearance?

They thought in order to make the product look fancy, the product should have many colours instead of having one grey standard to meet different customers' needs.

The user interface designer and the industrial designer agreed that the colour of the product should be yellow and the image of the society had to be recognised. However, they were not so sure about how to make the remote control look fancy, not funny.

The user interface designer thought that the product should be yellow because people like the colour yellow and the image of the society had to be recognised. However, the industrial designer was not so sure about how to make the remote control look fancy, not funny.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the project manager's opinions towards product appearance.

The project manager agreed that the product should be good-looking but having many colours wasn't a good idea because it would increase the product cost. Also, the project manager thought the remote control should be marked with the image of the society so that one can recognize it at a glance.

The project manager thought that the colour of the product should be yellow and the image of the society had to be recognised so that customers would recognize the product when they saw it. Also, the remote control should be attractive and not too many buttons.

The project manager wanted the product to be fancy, powerful and easy to use. He also wanted the image of the society to be recognised in the product such as the colour and slogan.

What were the statements discussed by the members?

Several members expressed their gratitude towards various groups such as first responders, working populations and different companies that have come together to help with the COVID crisis. Students whose education had undergone a radical change were highlighted and their fortitude appreciated. There was also a call to rally for disenfranchised groups such as rural residents, black lives movement and non-binary persons.

Hon. Steven Guilbeault (Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion) introduced that the government was fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the Auditor General, an independent officer of Parliament. However, the opposition party argued that the Prime Minister had not done enough to meet the needs of Canadians during the pandemic. The opposition party also alleged that the prime minister had misled the House in his response to a question about COVID-19.

The members expressed their concern over the COVID-19 pandemic and expressed that the government had not done enough to meet the needs of Canadians during the pandemic. The Prime Minister misled the House in his response to a question. The members also expressed their support for the people of Sudbury who had risen to the challenge and joined forces in the face of COVD-19.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the Prime minister and Government accused of?

The liberal of Government was accused of not allowing for adequate scrutiny of their spending. The Prime Minister was accused of locking down Parliament to avoid accountability, refusing to hold a first ministers meeting and refusing to negotiate to pass a bill.

The Prime Minister and Government were accused of being reckless in their response to a question from the opposition party. The Prime Minister had ordered Canadians to stay home and businesses to remain closed, at a time when Canadians had had to say goodbye to their relatives over Skype, and Canadians were not allowed to take their kids to the park, and restaurants were fined $800 for allowing customers to eat outside and not being socially distanced, in these times, the Prime Minister's son attended a mass gathering with thousands of people while not socially distancing.

The Prime minister and Government were accused of withholding an economic update from the opposition parties and the public. The opposition party alleged that the Prime Minister had locked down Parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition, while the economic recovery must be prepared. The Prime Minister was also accused of not providing adequate funding for the Canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities, and the Government was accused of failing to provide adequate funding to the wage subsidy for more businesses and to create flexibility for the CERB.

==================================================
==================================================
Which groups did the members discuss to have been impacted heavily?

Members advocated for aboriginals who faced police brutality, students for their disrupted education, indigenous and rural residents for lack of access to the internet and the black lives movement.

The members discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various groups, including veterans living with disabilities, those who received CPP and those who receive disability payments, as well as those who were dependent on the CERB. Many of the members also expressed concern that the government had not taken any action on this issue.

The members discussed that many groups had been impacted heavily by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as veterans living with disabilities, those who receive CPP and those who received disability payments. The members also discussed that the government had failed to provide adequate funding for the Canada emergency response benefit and the wage subsidy.

==================================================
==================================================
What was said about the Auditor General?

The Prime Minister was quizzed on why he wasn't providing the money to allow the Auditor general to conduct audits on the Government's spending. The Prime Minister responded as to having increased the budget of the Auditor General's budget the previous year. The response was deemed unsatisfactory by the questioning party.

Hon. Steven Guilbeault (Minister of Canadian Heritage) introduced that the government had already increased the budget of the Office of the Auditor General in the 2018-19 period. With this increase, the office was able to add the equivalent of 38 full-time staff to its team. The Auditor General had indicated that she would be able to do half as many audits, despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending.

Steven Guilbeault (Minister of Canadian Heritage) said that the government was fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the Auditor General, an independent officer of Parliament. The Auditor General had indicated that she would be able to do half as many audits, despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending. The government had added 38 permanent staff positions to her office, while the Conservative government, under their leadership, cut the funding for more than 60

==================================================
==================================================
What was the issue around the CERB?

Members quizzed the Prime minister on what would happen to the CERB as many of their constituents were depending on it. They stressed for urgency and clarifications for when it would be provided to allow for the affected population to plan for the future. Many people depended on CERB for their living.

According to Jagmeet Singh, a family that needed to buy groceries can't take those pretty words and buy groceries with them. The CERB would not be able to provide the necessary support for families in need. The Prime Minister had promised that if the government extended it, it would help all Canadians living with disabilities. However, the opposition parties had decided that rather than help 40%, or a significant portion, of people with disabilities, he wanted to help none of them. That was the wrong approach.

Jagmeet Singh asked the Prime Minister to extend the CERB for families in need. Right Hon. Justin Trudeau said that discussions were ongoing on that, but he could assure Canadians that they would continue to be there for them and support them, as they had been.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize what was said on the GBA+ analysis?

A committee member repeatedly asked why a GBA+ analysis was not conducted on the COVID-19 relief programs since this would have prevented rolling out inadequate programs for women. The quizzed party responded by pointing out to their successful efforts with some of the women and stressing that women were at the core of their decision making.

According to the GBA+ analysis, Canada was struggling to secure a reliable source of PPE. Some equipment procured from overseas had been substandard and couldn't be used. The government was giving about $115million to Quebec, but that was not even 4% of what was being requested. It was clear that Canada needed to rely on Canada for PPE, and the government was working hard to build up domestic capacity.

Mr. Steven Guilbeault introduced that the government had added 38 permanent staff positions to her office, while the Conservative government, under their leadership, cut the funding for more than 60. However, the opposition party argued that this was not good enough. The government was giving about $115million to Quebec, but that was not even 4% of what was being requested. The opposition party also argued that the Minister of Public Services and Procurement had not provided a target for a daily antibody test to complete an initial survey or the initial phase of a study.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about the product features.

The remote control had to be original, trendy, easy to use, international and not too expensive.

The team agreed that the remote control should be original, trendy and user-friendly. It should be not too expensive and easy to use. The selling price of the product would be 25 Euros.

The team agreed that the remote control should be original, trendy and user-friendly. It should be priced at twenty-five Euros and not more than twelve Euros and fifty Euros. The team also agreed that it should be easy to use and not too expensive.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did Project Manager propose that the product should be international when discussing the product features?

Because it would be sold in the entire world and everyone would use it.

Project Manager proposed that the product should be international because people would be interested in buying a new remote control with new functionalities that didn't exist in the existing remote controls now. Besides, Project Manager believed that the price of the product would be reasonable as it would be 25 Euros and the selling price would be not more than 12.5 Euros.

Project Manager proposed that the product should be international because everybody would have to use it. Also, Project Manager believed that people would be interested in buying a new remote control with new functionalities that didn't exist in the existing remote controls now.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the conclusion of the discussion about the product price and cost as a part of the product features.

The remote control would be priced at 25 Euros and the product cost would be no more than 12.5 Euros.

The selling price of the product would be 25 Euros and the product cost would be 12.5 Euros, which was reasonable. It would be sold in the entire world, and it would be not more than 12 Euros and 50 centimes.

The selling price of the product would be twenty five Euros and the product cost would be not more than twelve Euros and fifty Euros.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about the work division of the project.

Project manager would manage the whole group. Industrial Designer would think of the functions of the product. User interface designer would concentrate on the users' requirement and the relation between the users and the remote control. Marketing would give interface designer and industrial designer some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have.

Industrial Designer was responsible for the industrial design of the remote control, User Interface Designer for the user interface design, and Marketing Expert for the detailed design. Project Manager would be the manager of the project. User Interface Design would have to work on the design and also to work with the technical fun functions and think of the user requirement specifications. Marketing Expert would be in charge of the marketing trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have.

Industrial Designer was responsible for the industrial design of the remote control, while User Interface would be responsible for designing the user interface. Project Manager would be in charge of managing all the group members.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the industrial designer's opinion about the job of user interface designer when discussing the work division?

Industrial designer thought user interface designer's job was to focus on the relation between the users and the remote control and decide how the object looks – for example, where the button would be.

The industrial designer thought that the user interface designer would design how the user would know the relation between the user and the remote control so that the product would look like. The function designer would take care of the industrial way to transform it.

The industrial designer thought that the user interface design is the relation between the user and the remote control so users should know how the remote controls should look like. The industrial design is how the object will look like and how it should be used.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the conclusion of the discussion about the difference between the industrial designer and user interface designer?

Industrial Designer would design the functions and figure out the industrial way to implement it while the user interface designer's job was to decide how the object looked. In short, the two were like the inside and the outside.

Industrial Designer thought that the user interface design was the function design. User Interface Designer thought the industrial design was how the user would know the relation between the user and the remote control and how the object would look like. Industrial Designer thought User Interface Design was the interface design.

Industrial Designer thought the user interface design would design how the user would know the relation between the user and the remote control so User Interface thought the industrial design was how the object would look like.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Grad B say about the structure of the belief net?

It is necessary for the belief-net to have at least one layer of nodes between the features and the final output. This makes the structure more flexible in terms of coding feature-layer probabilities. 

Grad B explained that the initial idea was to have a flat structure with all the features pointing to the output node. Grad B thought that this was not satisfying because there was a complete separation between the observed features and the output, and it would be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that. The middle layer would have features along the lines of where the person wanted to go and what they had said previously and what the means that they should use.

Grad B explained that the initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node. The middle layer would have features along the lines of where they want to go and what they've said previously and what means that they should use. The features would be either lexical or topic-based concept cues.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the next step on features?

The next stage is to refine the set of feature nodes and identify possible clusters. Although, in theory, traditional AI plan recognition techniques could also be helpful for inferring intentions, the schemas involved are too elaborate for this task. 

The team decided to add a middle layer of features to the model, which would allow the model to infer whether a person is a tourist or a tourist. The middle layer would consist of features along the lines of where they want to go and what they've said previously and what the means that they should use. The features would include the location of the landmark, whether the person is in a hurry or not, and whether they're running an errand or not.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize what was said on intentionality

There was a demonstration of the structure and the function of a toy version of the belief-net for the intentionality task. The features nodes include things like prosody, discourse, verb choice, "landmark-iness" of a building, time of day and whether the admission fee was discussed.

The intentionality of the model was discussed by the team. The first thing they got was that already the intention was already determined by parsing the data. The second thing was that the model would be able to distinguish between whether something had a door and was not public and whether it was enterable or not. The third thing they learned was that there would be a probability distribution over all verbs, which would allow them to infer whether the object was entering or not from the context.

The intentionality of the model was discussed by the team. The first thing they got was that already the intention was determined by parsing the data. The second thing they learned was that the model could distinguish between whether something has a door and is not public. The third thing they found was that there was a distinction between whether someone was on a tour, running an errand, or whether they were in a hurry. The fourth thing they discovered was that people would change their minds in the middle of the discourse. The team thought that they could add a middle layer to the model that would allow them to infer whether something was enterable or not.

==================================================
==================================================
How would the middle layer work?

The values these nodes take feed into the middle layer nodes identified as hidden variables of the user/device interaction, such as whether the user is on tour, running an errand or in a hurry. These, in turn, help infer whether the user wants to see, enter or simply approach a building.

The first idea was to add a middle layer, which would have features along the lines of where people want to go and what they should use. The middle layer would have a hidden layer that points to some of the real hidden layers, or the general hidden layer. The hidden layer would be a probability distribution over all verbs, and the probabilities would be probablistic over all verb types.

The middle layer would have features along the lines of where people want to go and what they've said previously and what means they should use. The features would be derived from the discourse and the context would be given in their input.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the importance of SmartKom?

SmartKom, although it does not code for intentions as specified in this task, provides a model of the discourse, which can be useful for the detection of features through querying and anaphora resolution. 

SmartKom was designed to deal with the problem of detecting whether a given object has a door and whether it is enterable or not. In order to do this, it was necessary to distinguish between whether something has a "door" and is not public. SmartKom would also help to detect whether the object is in a hurry or not, so that it can be more intelligible to the user.

SmartKom was designed to help facilitate the understanding of the ontology of a given situation. For instance, SmartKom would help to distinguish between whether something has a door and is not public. It would also help in the anaphora resolution and it would fill in all the structures that were omitted from the context of the utterance. In addition, it would help in coordinating the gesture screen issues.

==================================================
==================================================
What was said about hiring?

Experiments for the collection of new data will start soon, since someone who will recruit subjects and help run the experiments has already been hired and the designing of the experiments has also progressed significantly.

Hiring was discussed, and the team decided that they would look for someone with experience in the Bayes-net, preferably with a background in computer science. They also wanted someone who was familiar with Java Bayes and would be willing to learn more about it.

The team is looking for someone to fill the position of assistant manager. The position will be filled through a combination of part-time and full-time positions.

What did the group discuss about animal characteristics?

User Interface and Industrial designer drawn dolphin and pig, which the two animals have smart and easy-to-draw features. Marketing suggested a horse and Project Manager thought they should design a remote control that's water resistant, strong and furry. Also he mentioned that remote control will be priced at 25 Euros and aimed to earn a revenue of fifty million Euros. Therefore, Project Manager encouraged teammates to reflect on experience when designing its function and format.

Project Manager suggested that they should design a remote control that's water resistant, strong and furry. User Interface drew a dolphin because dolphins were smart and they jumped around in the water and they liked swimming and that was cool. Marketing drew a cat because cats slept all day and they were easy to draw. Industrial Designer drew a horse because it was pretty and they looked intelligent and they had binocular vision.

User Interface drew a dolphin because she thought dolphins were pretty and they went well with the environment. Project Manager thought dolphins are smart and they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool. Marketing drew a cat because cats sleep all day and are easy to draw. Industrial Designer drew a dog because he thought dogs were cute and soft.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Project Manager think of the call button suggested by User Interface?

The initial feature suggested by Marketing was easy to find and User Interface suggested a call button on the television. And Marketing wanted something that could vibrate or had a signal if it had no sound. However, they were not sure whether it is expensive to design it. So Project Manager suggested designing a magnet or portable phone based couch for the remote control, which people no need to walk over the TV to find it.

User Interface suggested that the remote control should have a call button on the back of it so that users could push a button on TV to be able to find their remote control. Project Manager thought that the call button could be a little light or even a vibrating thing because it was usually under the sofa.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about the remote control size.

Project Manager asked if the remote control needed to be made larger to avoid losing it. At the first beginning, User Interface suggested bigger, while Project Manager suggested a hand-sized device. Considering the light feature and putting noise on it, User Interface thought it would be feasible to make it mobile with a target price at 25 Euros.

The team agreed that the remote control should be hand-sized, so that it would not be too big to lose. It should not have too many buttons, and it should be mobile so it could run around and come back to find you.

The remote control should be hand-sized. It should not have too many buttons and it should not be too big or too small. The remote control could be made mobile so it could run around and come find you.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Project Manager think of the cost constraints on the telly screen with the programming function?

Since User Interface initially suggested less button feature on the remote control, so Project Manager suggested a telly screen like what phones have. And User Interface mentioned about the master control in electronic houses. However, User Interface thought it is a bit expensive to create this feature, but Marketing mentioned the similar screen in phones is in the acceptable cost range. So, Project Manager agreed and suggested further discussion in the coming meeting.

Project Manager thought that if the telly screen was already a screen, then it would be possible to have a programming function, really easy to scroll up and down, on the remote control. However, if it was not on the button but it was telling you what to do, then the cost of the programming function would be too high.

Project Manager thought that if the telly was already a screen, then they could have a programming function, really easy sort of arrow up and down, on the remote. However, the cost of the programming function would be 12.5 Euros.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did Project Manager suggest having a clip on the remote control?

User Interface reiterated that the remote control should have a robust and water resistant function. Marketing also mentioned a good tactile feel for the remote control function, which doesn't make hand sweat a lot. Therefore, Project Manager suggested a clip feature on the remote control so that people can clip it to their device.

Project Manager suggested having a clip on the remote control so that users could clip it to their remote control. However, Project Manager pointed out that the cost of a clip would be too expensive and they had to remember their budget of 12.5 Euros for the device, so they would have to see how much it would be.

Project Manager suggested having a clip on the remote control so that it would not make the hands sweat too much. However, Project Manager did not know how much the clip would cost and would have to find out on the internet.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group discuss about the project plan and target revenue?

The selling price goal is 25 Euros and profit aim is fifty million Euros. Selling target is four million and the profit goal is fifty percent. So Project Manager mentioned that the group hopes to sell the remote control device internationally, instead of in Scotland or some European country.

The group agreed that the selling price goal was 25 Euros and the profit aim was 50 million Euros. They would hope to sell this product internationally, and they would aim to sell a total of 2 million units.

The group agreed that the selling price of the remote control would be 25 Euros and the profit aim would be 50 million Euros. They would hope to sell this internationally.

Summarize the discussion about the effect of training on different languages

Using multiple languages led to more diversity which potentially hindered the model performance. The professor was skeptical about discussing the results since they had not received any good ones so far.

The team was concerned that the results were not as good as they expected them to be. The professor thought that the team should be careful because they had not done all their tests on multiple languages. The team thought that they should try testing on other languages.

PhD D informed the team that the model performed better on the task data when it trained on one language and tested on another, but the results were not as good on the multi-lingual task. The professor thought that it was interesting that going to a different task didn't seem to hurt the model that much and that the difference between three and four was not particularly great.

==================================================
==================================================
What did PhD D explain about the multilingual model?

PhD D explained that the multilingual model, trained on French, Spanish, and English, was trained with higher frame rates. It has slightly poorer results when delta was not used. All in all, the addition of English did not seem to help the model.

PhD D explained that the multilingual model was trained on the broadest possible set of features without the task specific features, but with increased frame numbers. The model performed better on the task-specific subset of the data, but not as well on the multi-language subset.

PhD D explained that the multilingual model was trained on task data and tested on other languages. The model performed better on the task data but performed worse on multilingual tasks.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the Professor think about the use of English?

The professor thought that the model did not get hurt that much because of the removal of English. He also thought it would be worthwhile to train on one language and test on another.

The professor thought that it was not so much that the team got hurt because they didn't have so much representation of English, because in the other cases they had something that was much more diverse. He thought that there was not much difference between the data with English and those without it.

The professor thought that the difference between two and three cases was not so much that the model got hurt because it didn't have so much representation of English. He thought that it might simply be a case that they had something that was much more diverse.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion on managing the complexity of the model

The team discussed the size of the neural net, which was just a simple net. At the time, it had 27 outputs, but the professor recommended that they use a larger net, with perhaps more features. They discussed the effect that removing silent frames could have on the model. The professor recommended having a bigger hidden layer, though he did not think that would substantially improve performance. Currently, however, the team was facing computational limitations.

The team thought that they could reduce the number of outputs of the neural network by adding more features to the model. They had come up with three types of broad phonetic classes. The team was concerned that the model would not perform as well on multilingual tasks. The professor thought that the team should be careful not to reduce too much information.

The team thought that they could reduce the number of outputs of the neural network by adding more features. They had come up with three types of broad phonetic classes, using place of articulation, place of manner, and manner-based broad classes. They also had a single net with twenty-seven outputs.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the team discuss about IBM computers?

The team was concerned about the availability of computational resources. The Professor informed them that they had received two 550 megahertz processors by IBM. Though, they were originally expecting eight 800 megahertz processors.

The team thought that IBM was a good choice for the task. The IBM computers were easy to learn and easy to use, and the team was familiar with IBM's software. The team also thought that they could use the IBM computers to train their neural networks on different languages.

The professor informed the team that IBM was going to be providing them with a new IBM computer on Monday. The team was excited about the new IBM computers. The professor informed them that the team would be getting a new one on Monday and that they would be able to start testing on it. The new computer would be compatible with their existing models, which would allow them to run more complex tasks.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the team think about delays?

The team talked about delays when discussing the removal of frames that were silent. This could possibly improve model performance at the cost of a small delay.

The LDA introduced delays but they were claiming that it was within the boundaries of the model. The team thought that this was a good idea because it would give a better word error result and therefore would help within an evaluation.

The professor thought that the delay was a good idea because it would give a better word error result and therefore would help within an evaluation. However, it would be tricky for listening to because these kinds of things cut speech off a lot.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about remote control style.

Marketing revealed that the younger target group preferred colourful objects and soft material. Project Manager agreed and added that the remote control should be light and not too slippery. Then Industrial Designer introduced three casing possibilities: uncurved, single-curved and double-curved. Considering that uncurved design could be too dull and double-curved design would make it difficult to use scroll-wheels, the team chose the single-curved design.

Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be curved in two dimensions, with push-buttons and scroll-wheels. User Interface suggested that it should be made of rubber and the material should be spongy. Industrial Designer also suggested that they could use a scroll-wheel with a button on it. However, Project Manager pointed out that it would be too dull to use scroll wheels and the group agreed to skip it.

The group agreed that the remote control should be curved in two dimensions and curved in three dimensions. The group also agreed to use rubber as the material and to make the material spongy. In terms of the shape, the group decided to make a round an oval remote control in yellow, with four push-buttons in a form of a round and a single-curved case. They also decided to use a scroll-wheel for the energy source and to use the regular chip instead of the advanced version.

==================================================
==================================================
What material did the team decide to use in the discussion of remote control style?

Industrial Designer supposed that natural feeling could be a factor. Marketing agreed and revealed that the younger target group preferred soft material but not necessarily a real sponge. Then User Interface proposed to use rubber, which was agreed by the whole team.

The team decided to use rubber with colours and spongy material because the younger target group liked bright colours, colourful shapes and fancy look and feel. The team also decided to skip the titanium stuff because the market was different and the younger group liked more colourful objects.

The team decided to use rubber as the material for the remote control because the younger group liked colourful and spongy material and the older group preferred dark colours and simple shapes. The team also agreed that the material should not be too hard.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the team choose single-curved design when discussing remote control style?

Industrial Designer introduced uncurved, single-curved and double-curved design at first. User Interface and Project Manager thought that uncurved design was too dull and Industrial Designer pointed out that double-curved design would make it impossible to use scroll-wheels, so the team selected single-curved design eventually.

When discussing the remote control style, Industrial Designer pointed out that double-curved design would be dull to customers because it would be hard to use the rubber buttons and scroll-wheels because it was all curved. Project Manager thought that the curved design was too dull for customers to like. Therefore, the team decided to stick with the simple straight-forward design.

When discussing the remote control style, Industrial Designer pointed out that double-curved design would be too dull for the customers, so the team decided to stick with the simple straight-forward design because it would be more appealing to the customers. Project Manager agreed and added that the team could use the rubber case and the scroll-wheels, but they could not use the push-buttons because they were all curved.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group discuss about user interface controls of the remote control?

Industrial Designer proposed to use scroll-wheels, which could be integrated with buttons. User Interface doubted its practicability and then Project Manager proposed to integrate a scroll-bar on the side to mute the device. As they would not use an LCD display, a regular chip was enough.

User Interface suggested that the group could make four push-buttons in a round shape and scroll-wheels in a form of a round. The group also discussed whether to use a scroll-wheel with a button on it or not. Industrial Designer thought that it would be better to use the wheel, but User Interface thought that there was no possibility for them to use it because it was too dull.

User Interface suggested that the group could make four push-buttons in a form of a round and two scroll-wheels could also be integrated with buttons. The group also discussed the shape of the remote control. Project Manager suggested that they could make a round an oval remote control in yellow.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the team think about scroll-wheels in the discussion of interface controls?

Industrial Designer proposed to use scroll-wheels integrated with buttons. User Interface doubted its practicability and supposed that a round button with four directions could be better. But Project Manager liked the idea of scroll-wheels as it might attract young customers and suggested that they could be used to mute the device.

Industrial Designer thought scroll-wheels were not really a scroll-wheel because they could not work with double-curved cases, but on their side, the volume button was on the side. Project Manager thought they could use push-buttons to control the volume. User Interface thought it was too dull to use scroll wheels with a button on it. Industrial Designer thought there was no possibility for them to use the scroll wheel because it was not a fancy new technology.

User Interface thought there was no possibility for the team to use scroll-wheels because they could not work with double-curved cases. Industrial Designer thought they could use a scroll-wheel with a button on it, but Project Manager couldn't see any scenario where they would use a button in the scroll. Project Manager thought they should skip the titanium stuff and use rubber with colours.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the team decide not to use LCD displays when discussing interface controls?

Industrial Manager revealed that if LCD was used, they had to choose advanced chips. Project Manager thought it was within the budget and LCD displays could add extra high-tech feeling. User Interface then pointed out that they already had too many high-tech substances including scroll-wheels, voice recognition and a fancy look so they didn't need to use LCD displays.

The team decided not to use LCD displays because they did not think they needed it on the remote control because it was not flashy and new. Also, they were not sure about the financial part of the cost. LCD was not standard and the market would not like new flashy technology.

Industrial Designer pointed out that LCD was not flashy and new, and it was less standard. Project Manager agreed, and added that the market would like a sort of titanium casing, but they seemed to like natural stuff. Therefore, the team decided not to use LCD displays.

What did the group discuss about how much employers understood the meaning of Welsh bac?

They all agreed that most employers did not have a clear understanding of what Welsh bac means or what it includes, which was a big problem not only for employers, but also for parents and young people. Though some small engaged employers did understand it, the vast majority focused more on running the business without a clear understanding.

According to Dafydd Evans, most employers in Wales were small or microbusinesses. Not many of them had indicated that the Welsh baccalaureate was providing the skills that they needed. They were having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications. Therefore, they did not really sell this to employers to actually engage with them. And the only way they would get employer buy-in was if they felt ownership of what's being done.

According to Dafydd Evans, most employers in Wales are small or microbusinesses, and while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. Therefore, the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers they work with. And the only way to get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what's being done.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Ed Evans (director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association) think about employers' understanding of Welsh bac?

Ed Evans thought employers did not understand it, but they would appreciate it if they do. This was particularly true for his own sector, the civil engineering sector, and particularly contracting sector. Because pupils usually did not have a very strong academic background in this sector, and Welsh bac gave them the opportunity to not pursue that much of academic, but tested them in terms of the challenges. Therefore, the growth of the Welsh bac would be valued at least for this sector.

Ed Evans (director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association) thought that most employers in Wales were small or microbusinesses, and most of them had not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. They were a little bit too focused on the academic side of things. The Welsh baccalaureate had turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which was putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, and the student getting all the information together at the end of the year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require was very questionable.

Ed Evans (director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association) thought that employers' understanding of the baccalaureate was not clear at the moment. Most of what they were questioning was the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within the professional sectors. They were questioning the qualifications that had been provided to develop the actual professional skills needed within the industries and whether that was developing the skills that employers require was very questionable.

==================================================
==================================================
What did they decide on how to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac?

They proposed that the voice of employers should be a key part of reviewing the qualification. Instead of colleges or qualifications boards doing this, employers themselves should do this qualification, which accorded to the vision of the Welsh baccalaureate, to improve skills for employment. They really should join employers and schools and education facilities together more in the future.

Dafydd Evans thought that they needed to review the qualification, and the voice of employers should be a key part of that review, so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills had more of a role within that qualification. The Welsh baccalaureate should be seen as an important part of creating a rounded individual ready for employment. And the only way they would get employer buy-in was if they felt ownership of what's being done.

According to Dafydd Evans, they need to review the qualification, and the voice of employers should be a key part of that review, so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within that qualification.

Summarize the views about how well the Welsh bac helped to prepare learners for employment.

One thing needing to be cleared was that Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications, but not just one qualification. To develop the employability skills was obviously a key part of it, but not all of it. It obviously worked well to help prepare for employment, but was not for everyone, because some people had to do the other things. It helped prepare some people, such as the A level students for university, but did not help health and social care people become more skilled and employable.

Dafydd Evans thought that one of the problems was that they had a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they needed to resit their GCSEs—in maths, English and Welsh. So, at level 1 and 2, there were fewer and fewer doing 1/2 in the baccalaureate because they were resitting their GCSAs, and there was much more use of the Welsh baccalaurate at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3. However, if getting the qualification was how they got the money, then they might be tempted to go for it.

==================================================
Summarize Kay Martin (principal of Cardiff and Vale College) opinion on how well the Welsh bac helped to prepare learners for employment.

Kay Martin agreed with other people's opinion. They tried their best to help learners to develop skills and employable people. Welsh bac worked well for preparing employment for some people, but not for everybody. Because some people came to school with very few GCSAs, or were lacking literacy or numeracy skills. Kay Martin thought this needed to be reviewed, to look at how they could actually make skilled and employable people.

Kay Martin (principal of Cardiff and Vale College) thought that the Welsh baccalaureate helped to prepare learners for employment, but it was not for everyone, because some people had to do the other things. The Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification, it's a combination. It helps prepare some people—the A-level students for university, but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable? No, it doesn't.

==================================================
Summarize Dafydd Evans' (chair of ColegauCymru) and Nick Brazil's (deputy principal) opinion on how well the Welsh bac helped to prepare for employment?

Dafydd Evans though that one of the problems was that there were a number of priorities. For example, there were a number of students who needed to resit their GCSE. It was important for everybody to get a C grade in those core subjects, but that would take some time from them teaching young people. Therefore, there were fewer and fewer doing level 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they were resitting their GCSEs. Nick Brazil added that Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications, and developing the employment was one of the key parts, but not all of it.

Dafydd Evans thought that one of the problems was that they had a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they needed to resit their GCSEs—in maths, English and Welsh. The Welsh baccalaureate was a combination of qualifications; it was not just one qualification. Therefore, there was no room for everything in the curriculum and no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications.

Summarize the views to what extent they believe that universities understood the value of the Welsh bac.

They thought most universities did not understand, based on some experience they had with some of their learners that went to Russell Group universities. But this depended on the admission tutors and the areas that they were going. Some areas valued it more, but some others did not.

According to Kay Martin, they don't think they believe that universities in the main understand the value of the Welsh baccalaureate, especially the experience they have with some of their learners to go to Russell Group universities. They do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade, but it's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels. It is mixed, and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they're going into in universities.

According to Kay Martin, they don't think they do, especially the experience they have with some of their learners to go to Russell Group universities. However, it depends on the admissions tutors and the areas that they're going into in universities. Some of the universities are not valuing the Welsh baccalaureate. They allow sometimes that you can drop a grade.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Nick Brazil (deputy principal) think about to what extent that universities understood the value of the Welsh bac?

Nick Brazil proposed an example of the institution himself was in. They had a long track record of getting learners into top universities. 50 percent of those Russell Group universities did not value Welsh bac for sure. But there were some offering an option with the Welsh bac, and those said it was on top of three A2 level grades.

Nick Brazil (deputy principal) thought it was mixed, and it depended on the admissions tutors and the areas that they were going into in universities. About 20 per cent of our learners went to Russell Group universities, and there was no doubt that they did not value the Welsh baccalaureate. But if they did offer an option with the Welsh, they said it was on top of three A2-level grades. So, they did accept it. It was valued by them and they accepted it, but when people went further afield, they were always trying to push our learners beyond.

Nick Brazil (deputy principal) thought that it was mixed, and it depended on the admissions tutors and the areas that they were going into in universities. In some areas, and certainly the local universities around here—University of South Wales, Cardiff Metropolitan University—value it in a great number of subjects, particularly in sport, when our students went to Cardiff Met, and business studies, when the learners went to USW. But some of the universities were not valuing the Welsh baccalaureate.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the situation in north Wales when discussing to what extent that universities understood the value of the Welsh bac?

Welsh universities were much more willing to recognize the bac. Therefore, it was not a huge problem there. However, students who were looking to go out to universities in England encountered some problems. But in terms of Bangor and Glyndŵr University, there was no problem.

According to Dafydd Evans, there was no problem there. Because of the nature of the catchment area, there were a greater percentage of students staying in Welsh universities and, as Kay said, Welsh universities were much more willing to recognise the baccalaureate. However, the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities would make different decisions, and also make the decision dependent on whether it was a facilitating subject or an enabling subject, which the Russell Group report indicated about facilitating subjects, and Welsh bac at the moment was not a facilitating

According to Dafydd Evans, there was no problem there. Because of the nature of their catchment area, there is a greater percentage of their students staying in Welsh universities, and, as Kay said, Welsh universities were much more willing to recognise the bac. But, naturally, they did have students who were looking to go out to universities in England in the Russell Group, and they were having the same experience there where there were differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happened on the ground when students had interviews in those universities.

==================================================
Summarize their opinions on introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac.

They thought that a lot of skills and challenges that were done within the Welsh bac were very similar with the vocational qualification. Therefore, a number of those staff had already got those skills. Besides, for the vocational lecturers to do that, they had invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac and got positive outcomes of the Welsh bac, which had been an intensive staff development process.

Dafydd Evans thought that training was required regarding the Welsh baccalaureate, but where they are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. Therefore, if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualized, and for the vocational librarians to do that, and they've invested heavily in training those vocational teachers to understand how to deliver the bac. They need to spend less time in checking what they've done on assessment and more time in the doing, and the experiential learning that they need to do.

According to Dafydd Evans, training is required regarding the Welsh bac, but where they are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. Therefore, no, they think that if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualised and for the vocational lecturer to do that.

And this had been an intensive staff development process.

Dafydd Evans (chair of ColegauCymru) thought that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh baccalaureate would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. However, he thought that if it was going to be a success, it had to be contextualized, and for the vocational lecturers to do that, and they had invested heavily in training those vocational librarians to understand how to deliver Welsh bac and get positive outcomes. He also thought that there was a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world were not A-Levels.

Dafydd Evans (chair of ColegauCymru) thought that training was required regarding the Welsh baccalaureate, but where they were seeing it more successfully was where vocational lecturers had actually taken it on board.

What were the specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum that would be included in the primary legislation?

Kirsty Williams AM introduced that first of all, the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in learning and experience. Second, the government also intended to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects like literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency. Third, a statutory provision for the 'what matters' statements would also be included.

According to Kirsty, the original proposal that they began working on was to provide for the four purposes—so, the four main purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you'll all be familiar with. Then, below that, they were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency—which had already been made that statutory, so, for instance, above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports. Also, they would make a statutory provision for the 'what matters' statements within that, which would provide greater certainty and greater clarity about the expectations at a national level.

According to Kirsty, the original proposal that they began working on was to provide for the four purposes. Then, below that, they were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so, the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where they had already said that they would make that statutory, above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports. They would also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out their approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas.

==================================================
==================================================
What would be added to the legislation?

Kirsty Williams AM explained that the area of learning and experience for well-being was already there, and what would be included was the things that matter in the area of learning, and it was going to be put into the legislation. Lynne Neagle AM added that every school would have to teach mental health by law since the 'what matters' referred to both physical and mental health, and the government intended to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements were a set given in the system.

The two main new areas that they are now working on to include within the Bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody and to ensure the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system. They will make a statutory provision for the 'What matters' statement. They would also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out the approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the meeting discuss about the 'what matters'?

The 'what matters' was the articulation of the big ideas and it was to make sure that essence of the core content was consistent. The actual wording of the 'what matters' statements would be in the secondary legislation. At that time, the need to deliver and the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters' statement would be on the face of the Bill. As a result, mental health would be put in an important place.

According to Kirsty, the 'what matters' were the articulation of the big ideas. They were always intended to represent, as a whole, the learning that every learner should get. They would be brought down again to the 'What matters' statements within that, providing greater certainty and greater clarity about the expectations at a national level.

According to Kirsty, the 'what matters' are the articulation of the big ideas. They were always intended to represent, as a whole, the learning that every learner should get. They would make a statutory provision for the 'What matters' statements. The actual need and the compulsion, the expectation that you have to do that, would be on the face of the Bill.

==================================================
==================================================
What value the government placed on different sectors?

Kirsty Williams AM suggested that Welsh Government had always been big supporters of WISERD (WalesInstitute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods). More research into Welsh education would always be needed. As a Government, all aspects of concerns of Welsh education should be taken into consideration as the government was planning the new curriculum. For instance,  empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teached their children actually gave the government an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of the school children than what they had at the moment.

According to Kirsty Williams, the government was big supporters of the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton. The government believed that the Welsh Government needed more research into Welsh education, not less. The Welsh Government would continue to support the work of WISERD and the work that they were doing.

According to Kirsty Williams, the government valued the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton. They always supported the work of WISERD and the work that they did, and they needed more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, they found their papers really helpful and help them to inform their work.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the WISERD research suggest about the distinction in schools?

Hefin David AM introduced that the WISERD research suggested that the senior management teams and classroom teachers would share different views towards the change since classroom teachers would be more sceptical. Kirsty Williams AM explained that classroom teachers were absolutely crucial to this, as a result, difficult step had been taken to delay the implementation of the curriculum to same some amount of time to make sure that it was not just school leaders but individual classroom practitioners who had the skills that they would need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allowed them. To ensure this process, different accountability frameworks to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum would be incorporated.

The WISERD research suggested that the senior management teams would certainly buy into what the management teams were saying, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. The primary purpose for assessment was for that professional to be able to know how to move that child's educational journey on, and they would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents, whether they were using formative methods of assessment or summative methods.

The WISERD research suggested that the senior management teams would certainly buy into what the management teams said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. The reason was because there had not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability, and when schools started using assessment for accountability purposes, that's when the assessment process got corrupted and they had gaming.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the meeting talk about the model of Scotland?

Hefin David AM asked about what lessons could be learned from the introduction of the Scotish curriculum. Kirsty Williams AM explained some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum, including assessment and content, which had been a crucial part of the process. Also, professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes was an alert to the Welsh government. Steve Davies added that one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content and it could be a fit for the new curriculum.

The first thing to realise was that the curriculum was not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it was always useful to reflect on how other systems had undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that had arisen. The second thing to realize was that their curriculum was a copy-cat of other systems, but they had had people who had been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of their curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we had had in terms of developing coherence. The third thing was that they had embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of the curriculum assessment group. The fourth thing was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content.

How would the money for supporting teachers help in the preparation of the implementation?

To answer Dawn Bowden AM's question, Kirsty Williams AM first indicated that the money was not an insignificant amount but the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. The money was being made available to each and every school and had empowered head teachers to think about the professional needs of the school and the practitioners in the school. Also it was aimed at a national level, but to start with, schools would be assessed individually.

The money was being made available to each and every school and empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we had just heard from Claire, there were some schools that had been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore were further along that development chain. There were other schools that maybe were only beginning now, now that it was published, to be really engaging with the curriculum. So, investing in the profession was absolutely crucial.

Dawn Bowden AM wanted to know how the money that was announced for supporting teachers for the preparation of the implementation, how that's actually been used. Kirsty Williams AM explained that there was a national element to it, but they had given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because they had no way of knowing how each individual practitioner was ready or how much additional support they were going to need.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the money like in the professional development preparation?

The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and continuously, cooperation with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning would be included to campaign for more money allocated specifically beyond the two years.

The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and, clearly, Kirsty Williams AM continued to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning. There would be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development, as well as anything else. The schools as learning organizations were an important part, again, so that money was being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the OECD.

According to Kirsty, it was the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. The money was being made available to each and every school and had empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we've just heard from Claire, there were some schools that had been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore were further along that development chain. The innovation schools had led to a very specific piece of work as they did the final refinement, and their main role was working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues. They were also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they had across the system.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the meeting discuss about the innovation schools?

Kirsty Williams AM pointed out that all schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into innovation schools, as the next phase. There would be both a downside and an upside for the programme of innovation schools. At this stage, it should be better to move away from the original 's AM concluded that pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum. In this case, school with a specific aspect of strength should be encouraged to apply.

According to Kirsty Williams, the innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as they do the final refinement, and their main role was working with schools on the final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues. The innovation schools were chosen because of their ability to do that. They were also chosen because they were able to meet with the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model. They had 16 schools that were invited to apply to morph into the next phase, which was innovation schools, and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within Welsh Government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do the role and to continue to work with us, going forward.

How was awareness and understanding of human rights embedded in the new curriculum?

Kirsty Williams AM explained that children's rights and human rights had been key considerations throughout the design, and this was currently set out in overarching guidance and the government continued to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. And initial assessment from the children's commissioner's office had demonstrated that what was proposed in the new curriculum was a big stepforward. Also, the current existing output of that engagement and feedback had been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning, which was certainly a powerful contribution.

Children's rights, human rights, were key considerations throughout the design, and this was currently set out in overarching guidance and they continued to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. They had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and they had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms. The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning.

==================================================
==================================================
What should be included in the implementation of the Welsh dimension?

Sian Gwenllian AM pointed out that the Learned Society of Wales had said that there should be a directory of resources to implement that Welsh dimension. Kirsty Williams AM introduced that there was a separate programme of work that was looking at resources needed to support the curriculum and it certainly would be a must.

Kirsty Williams AM thought it was really important that whatever resources they had to support the Welsh dimension were really broad and not confined to specific areas. The continuum for language would have to be contextualized depending on the setting where a child was being taught. There would be progression points on that continuum that would be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language and they would be contextualised. They would also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out the approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas and some of the advice that they had had in terms of developing coherence.

And there would be progression points on that continuum that would be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the meeting talk about the single continuum of learning with regard to the Welsh language?

Kirsty Williams AM suggested that it was really important that whatever resources there were to support the Welsh dimensionare in a broad level and not confined to specific areas. Regardless of the type of schools, attention to the Welsh language should always be included. However, there might be change towards this implementation this year and it was unclear whether it would be discussed by different sectors.

The continuum for language would have to be contextualized depending on the setting where a child was being taught. There would be progression points on that continuum that would be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language, and they would be contextualised. They had to recognise that there would be a Welsh dimension right the way across the curriculum, and it was important that whatever resources they had to support the Welsh dimension were really broad and not confined to specific areas. They also had to contextualize that learning continuum according to the medium of tuition with the school, but recognising that it was a progression.

The progression steps and achievement outcomes in Welsh-medium schools would be more speedy and quicker, and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning Welsh in an English-medium school. The continuum for language would have to be contextualized depending on the setting where a child was being taught.

What did the group talk about the conceptual design of the remote control, including the functions and some possible advanced techniques?

In order to make a satisfying profit, the group had to set their price at 25 euros, which was relatively high. For fear that the higher price would lead to fewer consumers, they decided to make it a universal remote control, being able to function on different TVs. The group also planned to add a touchscreen onto the remote control and even include some games for children. What’s more, they paid some attention to the energy source, whether it should be a rechargeable one or just use normal batteries.

The group agreed that the remote control should be original, trendy, user-friendly, and not only for technical persons. It should be big enough for the buttons, but not too big, and it should not be too small. The group also agreed that it should be made of a different form than a normal remote control, so that it could be more trendy and trendy. They also agreed to make it child-proof and to care for the strength of the remote controls.

The group agreed that the remote control should be original, trendy, user-friendly, and not only for technical persons. It should not be too big or too small, and it should be made of plastic. The group also agreed to care for the strength of the remote controls, because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often broken.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the Project Manager think of the remote control when talking about the conceptual design of the remote control?

When discussing the remote control, the group tried to set the price at 25 euros, which was relatively high, at least compared to the existing ones. For fear that such a high price would lose their potential consumers, the Project Manager decided to aim their product at a universal one. According to the Project Manager, only by making it a universal remote control and adding other unique characters could it attract more consumers, then eventually reaching their profit expectation.

The Project Manager thought that the remote control should not be too big because it had to have a lot of functions and the strength was not as good as a normal remote control. Also, it should be clear so that kids and elderly users could use it from everywhere in the room, and the infrared thing must be from very good quality.

The Project Manager thought that the remote control should not be too big or too small because it had to have a lot of functions. The remote control also had to be clear so that kids and elderly could use it from everywhere in the room, and the infrared thing must be from very good quality.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the Marketing disagree with the Industrial Design when discussing the possible advanced techniques on the remote control?

When discussing adding several advanced techniques onto the remote control to make it more unique, the Industrial Design put forward to using the touchscreen. Notwithstanding the merits of the touchscreen, for instance, a touch screen would make the remote control easier and smaller, the Marketing did not agree to do so just because in that case they would be beyond the budget.

The Marketing thought that the remote control should not be too big or too small, because it had to have a lot of functions and the strength was not as good as a normal remote control. Also, the Industrial Design thought that a touch screen would be too fragile and not reachable.

The Marketing believed that the remote control should not be too big or too fragile because kids and the elderly were likely to use it and touchscreen was not suitable for kids. Also, the Industrial Design thought that it would be too expensive to put a touchscreen on a remote control because it was much too expensive.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Industrial Design suggest to do when discussing the conceptual design of the remote control?

When discussing the conceptual design of the remote control, the group noticed that the energy source was also a problem worth concern. The Industrial Design proposed to make it rechargeable at first, but because of their limited budget, he had to change his idea. The Industrial Design then put forward to setting a station at home or perhaps just using normal batteries to run the remote control, both of which would be feasible.

Industrial Design suggested that the remote control should be made of a square shape so that it would not be too big or too small, and that it could be made with a small touch screen on the top so that the buttons would be easy to reach. Also, the infrared thing must be from a good quality and the infrared would be from very good quality. Industrial Design also suggested that it should be clear so that kids and elderly people could use it.

Industrial Design suggested that the remote control should be made of plastic and made to be kid-proof so that it could be used from everywhere in the room, and the infrared thing must be from very good quality. Industrial Design also suggested that it should not be too big or too small because it had to have a lot of functions.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the button layout, the shape and the appearance of the remote control.

The User Interface drew a draft for the group to get a more direct idea about the button layout. Through a brief discussion, they agreed that as long as they made the button clear enough to be recognized, it would not matter much where the exact button was. The group also thought about a remote control which was able to be folded, in order to test if it would be strong enough to stand hit.

The remote control would have basic things on the same place, like on off button on top and the TV channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume on top, so that the user could see the basic options on the remote control. It would be big enough for the buttons, but not too big. The remote control should be made of a square shape and not too small. It should not be too big or too small, because it had to have a lot of functions. It had to be original, trendy and user-friendly.

The remote control would have the basic things on the same place, like on off button on top and the TV channels one two three four as a block, and the volume obviously on top, so that users can see. The on-off button should be on top so that it is easy to find. The remote control should not be too big or too small, because it has to have a lot of functions and the strength of the remote control is not as good as a normal remote control.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the User Interface suggest to do when discussing the button layout?

When discussing the button layout, the User Interface drew a draft to show how to make the remote control more unique and attractive. He suggested to put several essential and useful buttons together in the same place, and others might be scattered on the remote control, on all of which there would be clear logos. As long as the button layout was user-friendly enough, the User Interface thought it did not really matter much where the buttons would be.

The User Interface suggested that the basic things on the remote control should be on the same place, like on the off button on top and the TV channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume and the basic options on top, so that the user can see. The on off button should be clear so that users can see it, and the volume on top can be clear as well. The User Interface also suggested to make something like mobile phones that you can fold open to see more options.

The User Interface suggested that the basic things on the remote control should be on the same place, like on off button on top and the TV channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume obviously on top so that users can see. The rest of the buttons should be clear so that the user can see more options.

==================================================
What was the overall discussion of the meeting?

In this meeting, the speakers addressed issues that related to their meeting annotation progress. They talked about the types and variability of the future meetings. This led to them speaking about how to use their recording equipment if they got groups outside of their own departments to record meetings. Additionally, they discussed how to handle the storage of meetings on disk. They eventually address how to handle speech overlap and speaker anonymity, which were two crucial issues.

The meeting focused on the collection of data from the Meeting Recorder. The team was concerned that they were running out of space to store meeting data, and that they needed to consolidate meeting data onto one disk. The professor suggested that they could move the Aurora data onto the Broadcast News disk, which would give them more space, but the team was skeptical that this would be a good idea. They also discussed how they could get more data from a subset of the meeting participants, and how the data could be used for other kinds of research.

The meeting was primarily focused on the collection of meeting data. The team discussed the acquisition of more disk space for the recording of meetings and the potential use of the corpus for computational linguistics research. The meeting was also the first time that the team had a chance to meet with a new graduate student, who was interested in higher level topics such as language and disfluencies and all kinds of prosody. There was also some discussion about how the team could use the data they were collecting and how they could further improve their models.

==================================================
==================================================
What were some of the ideas proposed about future meeting recordings?

PhD F wanted the group to record different meetings with the same group to help in tasks such as summarization, the Professor D however, wanted random meeting participants to have diversity that would be instrumental in acoustical research.

The team thought that it would be a good idea to collect more data from different types of meetings. They would like to have more regular meetings of different types, but they should not have fifty different kinds of meetings to satisfy all the needs. They should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries.

Grad B suggested that the team should have a fair amount of data that is collected for the same meeting, so that they can have different summaries for different types of meetings. PhD C proposed that they could use a clustering algorithm or a person strong in neural net algorithm to classify speech and overlapping speech.

==================================================
==================================================
What was said on getting fluent English speakers?

Postdoc E was championing the need to get proficient English speakers so as to allow for a stable language model. This did not mean limiting the type of accents that the speakers had but rather ensuring the speakers could proficiently follow the English grammar when they expressed themselves.

Grad B suggested that the only thing they should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English. Postdoc E thought that it would be OK if a few people didn't have particularly good English skills, but it would seem to be a good thing if more people were more proficient in academic English.

Grad B suggested that the meeting should be held in English, but Postdoc E argued that it would be a good idea to have a meeting that has a goal and point. The professor disagreed and suggested that it should be a pre-existing meeting. Grad B thought that the only thing they should say in the advertisement is that the meetings should be in English.

==================================================
==================================================
What were the options that were discussed on the location of the recording equipment?

One proposed solution was to set up another room in the linguistics department. This needed a dedicated partner and safety of the equipment for it to work. Professor D talked about making the equipment portable allowing it to be transported from meeting to meeting.

The team discussed the location of the recording equipment and the possibility of placing it in the phonology lab or in the linguistics department. The team thought that it would be a good idea to move the Aurora data onto the Broadcast News disk and consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out.

One option was to set up the equipment in the linguistics department. Another was to move the equipment to the phonology lab.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group say on portable equipment?

The group wanted to introduce portable equipment so as to get more meetings from different groups. However, this was challenged by the complexity of setting up the recording equipment.

The professor thought that it would be difficult to put a lot of head phones in different people when recording only with a single device. The team would need to find someone on campus who was interested in helping with the recording, but they would need a motivated partner to do that.

The professor expressed concern that it would be difficult to put a lot of head phones in different people when they had to record only with tabletop microphones. The professor also suggested that they could set up a recording room in the linguistics department or in another building where they could record people.

==================================================
==================================================
What were Grad B’s updates on meeting disk storage?

Grad B said that archiving of the data by creating a clone had been done, though it took eleven hours. However, Grad B commented that accessing the data would be much faster. This archiving had freed ten gigabytes of free space. Additionally, two copies would be made: one offisite, another onsite.

Grad B informed the team that they were getting more space on the current disk. The SUN rack took more disk space than the Andatico one did, and the Aurora data was taking up more space. The team was looking into other vendors to consolidate meeting data onto one disk rather than spreading them out.

Grad B informed the team that they were getting more space on the current disk, which had enough space for four more meetings. They were also looking into other vendors.

==================================================
==================================================
What were other ways to get more space?

Professor D said they would be getting another disk rack that would bring in four thirty-six gigabyte disks, increasing the space. Additionally, the directories of Aurora data, Carmen’s Data and SPINE were likely to be moved.

One way to get more space would be to purchase a new disk rack and four thirty-six gigabyte disks. The SUN rack takes more disks than the Andatico one did, so the cost would be fifty percent more.

One way would be to move the Aurora data onto the Broadcast News disk, which would give the team ten gigabytes of space. The other way was to turn the Aurora files into a portable thing so that they could be wheeled around.

==================================================
Summarize the presentation and discussion on functional requirements.

Marketing gave some suggestions on the remote functional requirements based on marketing reports, which included a fancy look of the remote control, ease of use for elderly people, a button on the home station to trace its position, and speech recognition. So finally, the group mates suggested the usability and the color of the remote control based on Marketing's presentation.

Marketing first presented the functional requirements of the product. The product should be a beautiful remote control with good usability and stand out by being unique with the design. It should be made of good zap buttons and make it more like a mobile phone so that it would stand out from other remote controls. The new product should reach a new market with customers younger than 40 and not younger people. The user interface should be simple and standardised so that the remote control would be easy to use. There should also be a home station for remote control to recharge the batteries or something like that.

User Interface first gave a presentation on functional requirements of the new remote control based on a marketing report on the site. The team agreed that the remote control should only be used for television, and it should be made for children and elderly. They also agreed to make it a beautiful remote control, with good usability and stand out by just looks of it. Then, the team discussed the functional design. The group agreed to use the standardised methods like on all remote controls and make it universal so that it could be used with all the TVs.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did Marketing suggest giving up on speech recognition when presenting the functional requirements?

When Marketing mentioned that their target group should be both young people and people above forty who were not keen on new features, Marketing thought it would be too expensive to have the speech recognition and not reachable for twenty-five Euros. Also, Marketing suggested a DVD player, stereo, and VCR for television.

Marketing pointed out that younger people were more interested in new features than older people because they were more critical. However, older people didn't want to spend a lot of money on new features because they wanted to keep the old things the old way. Therefore, Marketing thought it was not useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition because it just wasn't useful enough.

Marketing pointed out that younger people were more interested in new features than older people, and older people were not willing to spend more money on new features because they were in their old thinking way. Therefore, Marketing thought it was not useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition.

==================================================
==================================================
What did User Interface think of Marketing's suggestion on the ease of use when presenting the functional requirements?

When Marketing mentioned that they should make a new product that looked fancy, fashionable, and was easy to use for elderly users, User Interface suggested making sure that the remote control had better usability and could stand out by just being watched. Also, Marketing suggested a different color or different shape.

Marketing suggested that the remote control should be simple and stand out by just the looks of the design. User Interface thought that the design was most important because there were already so many controls out that supported lot of stuff. So User Interface suggested that they could integrate the buttons in the design very much and make it a special product.

User Interface thought that the basic functions like numbers and the on-off button should be easy to use, and for elderly people big buttons should be put on the remote control to make it stand out.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the presentation and discussion on technical function design.

Firstly, User Interface suggested the group should stand up with a unique design like different shapes than usual. User Interface also suggested a new option for favorite channels and a menu button that could integrate with volume, the previous and next buttons. The group agreed to make the remote a bit smaller and would like to look at mobile phones when designing it.

Industrial Designer first gave a presentation on the working design of the remote control. The method he used was to search the web page provided by Marketing and found a lot of findings about the user requirements. Then, the group discussed the technical function design. User Interface suggested that they should keep it simple and stand out by the looks of the design. The group also discussed whether they should make the design more user-friendly by making it more like a mobile phone. Then they discussed whether there should be speech recognition or not. The team decided to skip speech recognition because it was not useful enough for old people.

The group discussed the technical function design of the remote control. Firstly, the group found out that seventy-five percent of the users found most remote controls ugly, and eighty percent of users would spend more money for a remote control that looked fancy. Secondly, seventy five percent of older people were more critical about where they spend their money money at. Thirdly, the team agreed that they had to stand out by just looks of the design. Fourthly, they agreed to use the standardised methods like on all remote controls to make it universal so that it could be used with all TVs.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about the evaluation criteria.

Marketing set the criteria for evaluation. The group gave two points on the fancy look and feel, three points on the ease of use and learnable, and two points on technological innovation because the group thought new features were not all extraordinary. Besides, they gave two points on the target market trend which said that the products with fruit and vegetables in different colors might be popular. Lastly, they gave high marks on the room for creativity and leadership.

Marketing made some criteria based on the marketing strategy, the new needs and the market. The team evaluated the criteria from one to seven, giving an average score of one or seven for each criterion. The average score was two. For example, the team gave a one for fancy look-and-feel, a two for innovation and a three for learnability. For the team to give a high score for creativity, the average score would be three.

Marketing evaluated the model on the basis of the market research, the marketing strategy, the new needs and the market trends. The team gave a one or a seven for the look-and-feel, the innovation, the speed, the colour, the material, the buttons, the backlight, the slide, the speech function, and the material. The average score for the model was one.

==================================================
==================================================
What's the conclusion on the discussion about the criteria of ease of use and learnable?

Project Manager thought the second layer of the remote was not easy to learn but Industrial Designer responded that users would not need to pay attention to that part. The group reached a consensus that the scroll wheel was much better than average. So they gave a two on this criterion.

Industrial Designer thought it was easy to use, but the scroll wheel was not as fast as a usual remote control, and the second layer was not easy to learn. User Interface thought scrollwheel was very handy, but it would be harder to learn the second part, like speech, because there were so few information that users could easily decide what buttons were for what function. Project Manager agreed that it was a good point.

The team agreed that the scroll wheel was easy to use and the second part, like speech, etcetera, would be harder to learn. The team also gave a three out of seven to the ease of use and learnability of the design.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Marketing recommend to do when discussing the evaluation criteria of market trend?

Project Manager thought they should skip the speaker when User Interface mentioned the power indicator. Marketing recommended that they need a button to beep for calling and they should include the speaker because it was usable and small enough. Also, Marketing supplemented that the production cost has been considered and within 12.3 Euros.

Marketing recommended to test the criteria from one to zero from the research about the new needs and the market, and give an average for each one to give a number. Then, the team could give their own average for the model.

Marketing recommended to test the criteria from one to zero. Then they could give an average for each criterion. For example, look-and-feel, innovation, technology innovative, etc.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about the project finance and the use of the drawing board.

The remote price would be at twenty Euros. And the production cost would be twelve point three Euros. And the group thought that the use of both the board and the pen to draw on the remote prototype was stupid and not handy enough.

The team agreed to use the drawing board as the main function of the product, but they did not want to draw on the blackboard because it was too slow and it was hard to make the drawings in normal computer style. Also, they thought it would be better if they could edit it from where they were sitting instead of pointing out on it.

The drawing board would be used for the prototype of the remote control. It would be a square with round corners and the material should be hard plastic, colour changeable, and transparent. The buttons would be made of hard plastic and the backlight would be LED. There would be two buttons for the zero and one for the for the more digit channels. The team would use the advanced chip for speech recognition, but they could not make a fancy prototype out of this because they didn't have any sizes and the team did not have enough time to design the inside as well.

==================================================
==================================================
What did User Interface say was the biggest problem when discussing the project finance?

User Interface mentioned that they got the wrong information at the wrong time, and it was the biggest problem. Otherwise, the group could finish the finance discussion earlier, and they should have had discussions quicker.

User Interface thought that they got the wrong information at the wrong time. They had so much information that they could have had a discussion really quicker, but they got it all wrong at the same time. Also, they didn't know how many buttons were required or what kind of buttons speech requires. So they had to include them in the design.

User Interface thought that they got wrong information at the wrong time and the team was not finished with the discussion. The biggest problem was that they didn't know how many buttons were required, or what kind of buttons. They also didn't have enough time to design the inside as well.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group discuss about simulation market evaluation of the new remote control?

Marketing summarized the user requirements according to the market reports. Users expected a fancy look, technological innovation, and minimization of repetitive strain injury. The team did a preliminary rating using a seven-point scale. The results were that the remote control's fashion style and location function were most highly rated, but the team was not satisfied enough with the minimization of repetitive strain injury. The team agreed on further modifications to the current prototype.

The group agreed that the new remote control should incorporate current fashion trends and incorporate current fruit and vegetable strong design colours. The design should minimise RSI and be easy to locate and easy to find. The group also agreed that voice recognition should be added to the remote control so that it would be easier to locate.

Marketing first presented the first stage of the evaluation, which was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of the company. Then, the group evaluated the prototype by rating it on seven points on a scale from one to seven. After that, the team discussed the design of the new remote control, including whether to use voice recognition and whether to have a beeper function. Finally, they discussed the price of the remote control and decided to make it fifty percent more.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Marketing think of the incorporation of current fashion trends in the prototype when making a simulation market evaluation of the new remote control?

Marketing initially doubted that Industrial Designer was limited in the use of materials for the prototype, which would harm the fashion style. Marketing was soon convinced by Industrial Designer, however, that the changeable faces would allow users to customize their remote controls. Besides, the rubber case would give a spongy feel. Marketing thus rated one point for Industrial Designer's style design.

Marketing thought that the incorporation of current fashion trends in the prototype was a good idea because the spongy texture to the exterior and fruit and vegetable design colours would make the remote control look and feel fancy and easy to use. Marketing also thought that it would be easy to locate and the design would minimise RSI.

Marketing thought that the incorporation of current fashion trends in the prototype was a good idea, especially in relation to the market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours.

==================================================
==================================================
What's the conclusion of the minimization of repetitive strain injury when making simulation market evaluation of the new remote control?

Marketing considered the design of pointers unfeasible, for many users were prone to zap. Project Manager recommended the slight and small-sized buttons with more space in between. Regretfully, the team failed to come up with a perfectly feasible solution to the problem. The team thus gave low rate points to the prototype's minimization of repetitive strain injury.

Industrial Designer thought that the type of button that they were going to use in the bottom half of the remote control, the material, and the shape of the rubber case would minimise the risk of repetitive strain injury. Project Manager thought that there was not much that they could do on the basis of current technology and their current capabilities, so they could not do much more to minimise that. Marketing thought that it was high enough at the upper end of the scale for them to go ahead with that.

The type of button that they were gonna use in the bottom half, the material, and the changeable faces would allow users to get any one of a number of colours that they wanted. The spongy feel was no problem with that.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about cost calculation and budget issues.

The team calculated the cost of the remote control in the Euro. The team included one regular chip, one kinetic cell, one double-curved bottom, one push button, one LCD screen, as well as rubber and plastic materials. The team decided to recommend voice recognition to business customers. Once the budget increased, voice recognition would be incorporated. Overall, the present cost was 12.5 Euros and was under the budget.

The cost of the remote control was 12.5 Euros, which was within the budget. However, the team was concerned about the overheads like overheads and the heating for the building, so they had to increase the price of the product. They decided to take the voice recognition out and only use standard batteries, which would bring the cost down to 12.3 Euros.

The team agreed that the cost of the remote control was 12.5 Euros, which was within the budget. However, they had to increase the price of the product by 50 percent to cover the overheads. They decided to take voice recognition out of the cost because it was not incorporated in the budget, but they could do the voice recognition for business class customers. They also decided to change the battery to a standard one.

==================================================
==================================================
What did User Interface think of the replacement of the kinetic batteries when discussing cost calculation and budget issues?

User Interface recommended the standard batteries to replace the kinetic batteries and lower the cost. Marketing was promised by User Interface that the change in battery type would not make any big difference in shape and colours. However, Marketing was still uncertain about the replacement. User Interface further explained that users were used to paying little attention to batteries which were installed internally.

User Interface thought that the replacement of the kinetic batteries would not make a huge difference because customers never said anything about the battery and customers were used to buying batteries. The biggest one would be taking away the voice recognition function, but if they took away voice recognition, people would not be willing to pay more for better product.

User Interface thought that the replacement of the kinetic batteries would not make a huge difference because customers never said anything about the battery and nobody looked into the battery. Besides, people were used to buying batteries.

==================================================
==================================================
What's the conclusion of the incorporation of voice recognition when discussing cost calculation and budget issues?

Industrial Designer implicated that if the kinetic batteries were replaced by the standard batteries, the voice recognition would have to be taken away as well. Project Manager, therefore, made a compromise that the team might provide the voice recognition in an upgraded version for the business class who expected high office specifications.

The team agreed that the incorporation of voice recognition would make the product more distinctive and set the remote control apart from the crowd, which would make it easier to locate in a first instance. The team also agreed that it would be quite loud and easy to locate, so they could adjust the volume on that, just as they could with the standard batteries.

Industrial Designer thought it would be quite loud and they could adjust the volume on that, just as they could volume on TV. Marketing thought the voice recognition sounds wonderful and their object was distinctive that that in itself would make it easier to locate in a first instance.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the meeting discuss about the funding issues?

The committee admitted that the funding issues brought more pressure on schools, especially after the new Act, for they would have to spend more in the light of it. It was pointed out that the government had not noticed the staff in the PRU, who required training. The committee was trying to communicate with Estyn and the Welsh Government for a broader range of measures to provide opportunities for schools and local authorities.

The committee members were aware of the funding issues and the challenges of funding that faced schools in general. In Torfaen, they knew that schools that were looking at their funding were behind, and they had to make these hard choices. They had to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners, then, and that did place additional pressure on the schools. It was difficult to know how headteachers and governing bodies would react. They would react in a particular way.

According to Sian Gwenllian, there was a question about the balance between funding being used for diagnosis and support, because the Samaritans report suggested that funding tends to go into diagnosis rather than support. However, in fairness to PRUs, they had been trying to work on the fact that, if children move out of school, the funding follows them, and that does place additional pressure on the schools. In addition, the additional learning needs sector was being adversely affected, worse than other sectors, and the new Act coming into force would lead to more exclusions.

==================================================
==================================================
What did David Hopkins think of the new Act?

David Hopkins agreed with Sharon Davies that the new Act would exert more pressure on schools. However, he denied that the levels of the delegation would have any impact. Meanwhile, he suggested that it would be better for the schools' headmasters and local authorities to look at the new Act more constructively, for it would be beneficial for the post-16 sector.

David Hopkins thought that the ALN legislation would put pressures on not just local authorities and schools, but also on the post-16 sector, because they were talking now about a wider age range—doing up to 25 as well. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister had currently made some more money available, if they looked at experiences that had happened in England, in particular, because there were direct parallels there with legislation, they would know from those experiences that ALN funding had become increasingly under pressure, and there had been big issues around tribunals, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribuni.

David Hopkins thought that the new Act would put pressure on not just local authorities and schools, but also on the post-16 sector, because they were talking now about a wider age range—doing up to 25 as well. It was difficult to know how headteachers and governing bodies would react. If they were under pressure financially or in terms of performance measures, they would react in a particular way.

==================================================
==================================================
What was considered by David Hopkins as the factor that affected exclusions?

David Hopkins did not think that the delegation levels were not high enough in most authority areas. Instead, he thought they had got agreements with the government to make sure that enough money was devolved to school. The true decisive factor was the narrow measure at the end of Stage 4 that drove the headmasters to exclude students or put them into another school.

David Hopkins thought the factors that really affected exclusions were the very narrow measure at the end of key stage 4 attainment, which had put pressure on some schools, certainly, and headteachers had felt that—sometimes excluded, or otherwise put into another school as a consequence, which was regrettable, but that's what's happened. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister had currently made some more money available, if there were direct parallels there with legislation, we know from those experiences that ALN funding had become increasingly under pressure, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribunals, because they were losing them time and time again.

==================================================
What did the meeting discuss about the networking within the PRU and the transition arrangements?

There had been improvements in the networking within the PRU, for they had national meetings on a regular basis, which could lead to a better sharing of practice. The PRU was planning to provide teachers with professional training. On the transition arrangement, the PRU was building a brand new provision in Swansea. The PRU would support students through a part-time timetable back into school. Besides, the support would not stop as soon as the students returned to school; the reduction of support would be managed.

According to Nick Williams, one of the things that had improved a lot was the networking within the PRU sector. The EOTAS group meets on a regular basis, and that's nationally. There's definitely a better sharing of practice. And they're talking about professional learning for any teacher or provider, or it's sometimes the more informal training they receive by making visits, joint visits, to provision and also using the expertise that they do have within the sector to work more closely with our schools, and vice versa, particularly around the curriculum.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the major challenge of the transition of the excluded students?

The students coming to the end of their statutory education were facing the biggest challenge, for it would be far more difficult for them to go back into the mainstream education process when they turned 15 or 16, not to mention the transition into further education, such as colleges.

According to Dr Ian Johnson, the more challenging learners were the ones who were coming to the end of their statutory education, the key stage 4. It was far, far more difficult when they were 15, 16 to get them back into mainstream. So, then they were looking more at how they transit, then, into further education and colleges and so on. There was also a problem with schools only being measured on academic outcomes rather than the journey travelled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of children who were particularly vulnerable.

The most challenging learners were the ones who were coming to the end of their statutory education, their key stage 4. It was far, far more difficult when they were 15, 16 to get them back into mainstream. So, then they were looking more at how they transit, then, into further education and colleges and so on.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the solution to the major challenge for the transition of the excluded students?

Sharon Davies recommended the team-around-the-family approach to ensure what was needed for learners to go back into school, as well as what the school could provide. She pointed out the importance of the whole package of support, which not only surrounded the learners but also their families. In addition, she gave an example of the PRU in Oxford who built the partnership between the school and the PRU student to demonstrate the responsibility of schools and the significance of school participation.

According to Dr Ian Johnson, the biggest challenge was the capacity. It was far, far more difficult when they were 15, 16 to get them back into mainstream. So, they had recognised that, so that they had their staff working very closely with the schools. There was an integration through a part-time timetable back into school, and they continued to support them during that process. Also, there was a team-around-the-family approach, to ensure what was needed for that learner to go back into the school, what can the school provide. There were restorative justice-type approaches being used by schools in Cardiff that seemed extraordinarily inspiring.

The main challenge was the lack of awareness and knowledge of children who had additional learning needs. The team-around-the-family approach, to ensure what is needed for that learner to go back into school, what can the school provide, and the shared ownership of the learner that the schools need to keep, because they want them reintegrated back into schools. There was also a lack of mental health support in mainstream schools, which could potentially lead to more learners ending up in an EOTAS provision.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the meeting discuss about the pros and cons of local authoritative frameworks?

One of the advantages was that youngsters' voice could be heard in time if they showed the willingness to go back into school; the framework offered the excluded learners a cooling-off period. The disadvantage was mainly some individual schools' lack of capacity to organize and offer additional training. Monitor and evaluation systems of the EOTAS provision were supposed to be set up to ensure the education quality.

The committee discussed the pros and cons of local authoritative frameworks. The pros were mainly about safeguarding, which was at the forefront of their thinking, and the cons were around safeguarding. Local authorities were struggling sometimes for additional provision, and they were struggling to manage those pressures in their own provision whilst they went out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision was adequate. They also needed to think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision would be trained and supported.

According to David Hopkins, local authorities do do that, but they're struggling sometimes for additional provision. At the moment, that is a struggle for them, because they're managing those pressures in their own provision whilst they go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is—. However, they don't want to make it too difficult, so that they haven't got any providers coming forward either.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Sharon Davies think of the role that local authorities should take in the quality assurance of individual intuition?

Sharon Davies expressed her strong objection to the exclusions caused by tuition or safeguarding. She pointed out that the difficulty with home tuition was the limited access the local authority could get into the families. The quality of home tuition was difficult to assure, unless the families invited them there, which was a really rare situation. All in all, the role of local authorities was restricted in this aspect.

In Torfaen, secondary schools had set out their own TCP—Torfaen curriculum panel—which looked at alternative provision. The meetings were facilitated and they were currently undergoing a review of the alternate provisions each school was doing because, sometimes, it was not quite working now, and it was understanding why.

The meetings are facilitated and they're currently undergoing a review of the alternate provisions each school is doing because, sometimes, it's worked in the past, but what they're seeing now is that it's not quite working now, and it's understanding why.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the conclusion of the discussion about the intuition in a private setting.

The intuition in a private setting was supposed to follow a restricted timetable, for no matter for what reason the students' need cannot be met at school, the PRU staff ought to provide them with some education. Besides, the education provided should be different from the education provided by agency staff, who merely offered a few hours' provision or the service offered by local libraries.

According to Dr Ian Johnson, the difficulty with home tuition was that as a local authority, they were restricted on how much access they could get into the home. They were restricted in that respect. There was a lack of awareness and knowledge of children who had additional learning needs, and they were not entirely sure of how good the support was at schools. Also, there was a problem with schools only being measured on academic outcomes rather than the journey travelled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of children.

The team members agreed that the problem with home tuition was that local authorities were restricted on how much access they could get into the home, and the school should be monitoring that provision and quality assuring that provision. Also, they needed to think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision could be trained and what sort of training and support they had.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the meeting discuss about issues on the special education and recruitment of professional staff?

PRU was supposed to collaborate with schools to arrange special curriculums to meet the students' special needs. This not only had something to do with finance but was also related to the recruitment of professional staff. The training for special education ought to be included in the professional training system.

According to Dr. Ian Johnson, the biggest challenge was the capacity. At the moment, a newly qualified teacher can't work in this type of provision, which is fine, but they need to perhaps get mainstream first. There really isn't the capacity for them to access professional training. So, they need a group of people in the future to fill those gaps. Also, they needed to ensure the right staff as well, because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise, and once that person had moved on, it was really difficult to start all over again.

According to Sharon Davies, the biggest challenge is the capacity. At the moment, a newly qualified teacher can't work in this type of provision, which is fine, they need to perhaps get mainstream first. But they need a group of people in the future to fill those gaps. There really isn't the capacity for them to access professional training. They need to ensure the right staff as well, because sometimes, they may have them, but if they move on or retire, or whatever, there's not a bus load of people with that expertise.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the major challenge of training professional staff for special education?

Dawn Bowden pointed out that there were a very small number of staff members working in the provision area, and the capacity for them to access professional training was limited. Sharon Davies agreed and added that though the situation had been bettered by the Internet technology, there was still not much opportunity for the ones who desired to specialize in the area.

The biggest challenge was the capacity to train professional staff for special education. Because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise, and therefore, it's quite niche, and once that person had moved on, it was really difficult to start all over again. There really wasn't the capacity for them to access professional training.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the conclusion of the discussion about the transport for EOTAS learners in rural areas.

There were more issues related to transport for EOTAS learners in the rural areas of Wales. The distance that the learners had to cover was huge, for they had to get a provision in Powys. However, WLGA (Welsh Local Government Association) admitted that this issue had not been investigated yet would be in investigation very soon.

According to Nick Williams, there was a PRU provision in the north of Powys and one in the south, so they had got provision for those types of learners there. But even so, the distances that those learners were having to travel were huge. It was a big issue. They needed to look at it in the bigger picture of what's happening, and they needed to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible had been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision, if it was possible.

According to Nick, there was a PRU provision in the north of Powys and one in the south of Wales, so they had provision for those types of learners there. But even so, the distances that those learners were having to travel were huge. For himself, and he would hazard a guess, Torfaen, they were relatively compact, so it was not such an issue.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about user interface design of remote control.

User Interface introduced a remote control easy to use and a multi-functional one and preferred the former as it was more user-friendly. Industrial Designer agreed and proposed that a stick or round button for volume control and channel selection could be used and also suggested that the ten digits could be substituted by voice recognition.

User Interface suggested that the easy-to-use remote control should be easy to use with not so many buttons. Industrial Designer thought that it should be a combination of volume and programme selecting, but teletext buttons were not in the design so it should take out eight buttons or so. User Interface also suggested that there should be no more than ten buttons on the remote control. Project Manager thought that they should go for the easier one because it would make a nice design when there's not much buttons in it.

User Interface proposed that the remote control should be easy to use with not so many buttons, with only a volume and a programme one button, and some fancy lights. Project Manager agreed and suggested that it should be an easy-to-use remote control with fewer buttons but a great feeling in touching the buttons. Industrial Designer agreed and proposed to use a round button instead of a stick.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Industrial Designer think about the ten digits when discussing interface design of remote control?

Industrial Designer thought the ten buttons looked a bit dull so speech recognition could be added to solve this problem. But he was concerned that power saving could be difficult when implementing speech recognition.

Industrial Designer thought that the ten digits would be a bit dull and the remote control could be combined with speech recognition to make it easy to change the channel. However, Project Manager thought that it would be costly and hard to implement. Industrial Designer also pointed out that younger people would probably watch more channels than the older people and younger people might not like voice recognition.

Industrial Designer thought that the ten digits could be combined with the find the remote control function, which would make it easy to change the channel. However, he was not so sure about the cost because it would be costly.

==================================================
==================================================
What did User Interface think about user interface design of remote control?

User Interface found two kinds of remote controls: the multi-functional one and the one easy to use. He emphasized on user-friendliness, but considering that the target people were less than forty years old, multi-function should also be taken into account.

User Interface thought that the easy-to-use remote control with fewer buttons was better than the multi-function one because the user-friendliness and it could be trendy in user design. User Interface also suggested that the remote control should take out eight buttons or so to take out the basic functions.

User Interface thought that the easy to use remote control should have only two functions, volume and programme, and it should take out eight buttons or so.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group discuss about technical issues of the project?

Industrial Designer introduced how the remote control worked and supposed that they should use infrared so that the remote control could communicate with most TV sets. He also proposed to use energy-friendly components and save the cost of circuit boards to develop elaborate lighting techniques. In order to prevent people from losing the remote control, the team decided to implement an audio signal. In terms of energy source, the team preferred to have a cradle so that the remote control could be recharged.

Industrial Designer thought that the remote control should not support teletext because the board felt that teletext was out of date and internet was replacing teletext, so they should not even try to implement it in their product. Project Manager thought that it would be a good idea to think about these buttons and and a sound signal. User Interface thought that they should focus on the easy-to-use remote control with not so many buttons and a simple design. Industrial Designer thought they should use a low-cost circuit board and incorporate energy-friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components.

Industrial Designer thought that the remote control should only be used for television, because teletext was out of date and internet was replacing teletext. Project Manager agreed, but Industrial Designer pointed out that there was no elaborate technique used in this kind of equipment. So they should concentrate on developing a product that is really what the market needs. User Interface suggested that they should think about these buttons and and a sound signal.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the team come up with to prevent customers from losing their remote controls in the discussion of technical issues of the project?

User Interface proposed that a base station next to the TV could be a solution, but Industrial Designer pointed out that this could be technically complicated and would cost a lot. So the team eventually adopted Marketing's advice to implement an audio signal.

The team came up with two solutions to prevent customers from losing their remote controls in the discussion of technical issues of the project. The first was to use a base station next to the TV, which would be the best solution because it would be easy for customers to find the remote control. The second was to add a sound signal to the remote controls, which could be combined with the find-the-remote control function. The team agreed on this solution because they thought that the most important thing for people was that there would be a central point to which they could go and perform some kind of some-kind of function, such as turning on and off the lights.

Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should have a central point to which customers could go and perform some kind of task, like turning on and off the lights. Project Manager agreed and suggested that they could use a base station next to the TV.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the team think about the energy source when discussing technical issues of the project?

Industrial Designer proposed to incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries, but Project Manager agreed more with Marketing's proposal to include a cradle.

Industrial Designer thought that they should infra use infrared because otherwise their device cannot communicate with almost every TV set. Project Manager thought that infrared was the right choice because it was easy to use and the cost-effectiveness of the device would be high. Industrial Designer also thought that the low-cost circuit board would be a good choice because most of the production cost were in this part of the equipment.

Industrial Designer thought they should infra use infrared because otherwise their device could not communicate with almost every TV set. User Interface thought the same as in the cell phone, just light in in the device that shines on all the buttons.

==================================================

Summarize the discussion about detailed design of the remote control.

There were two main parts in the detailed design. Firstly, the prototype presentation, Industrial Designer presented the design on the wheel, the button, and the base of the remote control. Secondly, Marketing presented eleven points to be evaluated based on the findings in marketing trend reports and company strategy marketing. Besides, the group had a point calculation on each evaluation criterion.

Industrial Designer first gave a prototype presentation of the remote control, showing the wheel that was used to change channels or volume or whatever, the power button, which was a button, a power button if you held it down, and if you just tap on it, the menu would bring up the menu. The base would be made of plastic and rubber, and the buttons would be interchangeable, so that users could change the colour according to their living room or whatever they wanted. The remote control would be hand-holdable and not too big, so it would be okay for the user to use it. There would be a hatch door for the more advanced iPod-like button, but it would not be to scale because it would have the battery inside it.

The remote control would have a wheel that could be used to change channels or volume or whatever. The base of the remote control, which had a squishy spongy rubbery feel, was interchangeable. The remote control could change the colour according to the living room or whatever, and it could also change the shape. It would be hand-holdable and not too big. There would be a hatch door for the more advanced iPod-like button.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about changing an aspect of the remote.

Project Manager suggested that the group might need to discuss changing an aspect of the remote. According to the previous evaluation, the worst one was material. Thus, the group gave suggestions on the smallish size, smashed or resembled fruit shape, and printed patterns on rubber design. The group also suggested changing batteries, but they ended up agreeing that there were no problems in battery design.

Industrial Designer thought the wheel would probably be larger because some of these remote controls were not as easy to hold. Project Manager thought the base would be bigger because it would be easier to hold in the hand. User Interface suggested that the buttons could be made in different shapes, but this would re-design the whole project because it might annoy people if they got used to having the buttons in one shape. Industrial Designer also thought that having different colours would be cheaper than having different shapes because they would cost more to produce.

Industrial Designer thought the wheel would probably be larger, because some of these remote controls were not as easy to hold. Project Manager thought the base would be larger. User Interface suggested that they could make the touch pad in different shapes, but then that kind of re-designs the whole project.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about the process of the project.

Firstly, Project Manager asked about the room for creativity in fruit and squishiness. User Interface thought the prototype making was creatively stimulating and the product has met all the criteria. Next, Project Manager reflected on his leadership and management role in the group. Other members gave recognition to his performance and everyone's cooperation. Then, Project Manager asked about the convenience of the means for the materials and the pen used in the presentation. Group evaluated based on the user-friendly and the working efficiency.

Industrial Designer thought it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute. User Interface thought the team worked very well together and they all had ideas about it. Project Manager thought they all worked well together because they didn't really have any set roles so much. Marketing thought they had a great team spirit and they knew what they were doing.

Industrial Designer thought the process was good and everyone got to contribute. Project Manager thought the team worked well together and they knew what they were doing. The team had a lot of creativity in the process and the product was fun and spongy. Then they talked about the means for the materials they used, like the pens, the whiteboard,

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the group decide to choose the aspect of the shape of the remote to change?

Instead of changing the shape of the remote, the group first discussed changing the batteries because some group mates gave a point under three. However, Marketing thought batteries were easy to insert so it would not be a problem anymore. In addition, all the group members gave the shape of the remote only two points. And they needed to change the most critical one. The shape and the squishiness of the remote were an innovation in terms of technology. Therefore, they all agreed to change the shape.

Industrial Designer thought the base would be larger because some of the remote controls were not as easy to hold. Project Manager thought the wheel would be bigger because it would be easier to hold in the hand. User Interface thought that the touch pad in different shapes would annoy people if they got used to having the buttons in one shape. Marketing thought that having different colours would be a good idea, but it would probably cost more to produce.

Industrial Designer thought the base would be larger because some of the remote controls were not as easy to hold. Project Manager thought the wheel would probably be bigger because the I-R's were right there, but it would be on one of the sides.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group think of the leadership in the process of the project?

Project Manager thought his leadership was crap personally and he never did a management position. While Industrial Designer thought Project Manager did tell them when to start and when to end, which was important in good leadership. And User Interface thought Project Manager did a good job in leadership because they didn't have set roles so much, which was a democratic process. Marketing supplemented that everyone got blended quite well.

Industrial Designer thought the team worked very well together and everyone got to contribute to the process. Project Manager thought the leadership was okay and that the team had a democratic process and everyone had ideas about it. User Interface thought it was good that they didn't really have set roles so much and that they all blended quite well together.

Industrial Designer thought it was a good process and everyone got to contribute. Project Manager thought he did a good job leading. User Interface thought they all worked very well together.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group think of the convenience of presentation materials?

Both User Interface and Industrial Designer thought it was not helpful to use PowerPoint to present. Instead, they preferred writing notes for massive information, while Marketing and Project Manager thought PowerPoint materials were quite useful. Specifically, Project Manager mentioned that he felt ignorant when the group was explaining things.

Industrial Designer was not a big fan of PowerPoint because he didn't really like the PowerPoint presentation and User Interface didn't like the idea of making up stuff and wrote a lot of notes instead. Project Manager thought that PowerPoint was not very user-friendly. User Interface thought that the information that was available to him was not that useful. Marketing thought that all this technology was more useful than looking at someone's notes because it was just the idea that they had.

Industrial Designer was not a big fan of any Microsoft, PowerPoint or any other kind of presentation materials. Instead, he used the Unix or the off market, sort of WordPerfect and all these other things.

==================================================
==================================================
What’s the thesis about?

The thesis proposal presents the idea of "construal" and makes claims as to how inferences are drawn in a probabilistic relational model by using information from the ontology, situation, user and discourse models. It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy.

The thesis is about the construction of a probabilistic relational model that has some general, domain-general rules how things are construed, and then a general mechanism for coercing them. The idea is to use ontology, situation, user, and discourse models to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilic relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what

==================================================
==================================================
What was said about EML talk?

The talk will present the work that is currently being done at ICSI including examples of inference of user intentions and of the recordings of the on-going data collection. The talk will also outline the theoretical (X-schemas, image schemas, Bayes-nets) and neural background.

EML is building up a huge biocomputation project in Leipzig, Germany, and the team is meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him on the idea. The team is working on the construction of a tablet-based parser and a generation outputter. EML is a different level of analysis, focusing on the double helix building, which is different from the standard model of the human-computer telephone conversation, but similar to the model in the MPI.

EML is building a building in the shape of DNA. The project is related to the MPI in Leipzig. The team is working on the construction of a tablet-based parser and a generation outputter.

==================================================
==================================================
What was said about the talk and neurons?

As the talk at EML will also refer to a theoretical framework, it was suggested that along with presenting NTL and the piece on mirror neurons, it also alludes to relevant fMRI work. The neural side of the research could be of interest to various groups. The language analysis itself will be introduced in terms of image schemas. On the other hand, it was arranged for more feedback on the thesis proposal to be sent by email. The latest version of the construction formalism will also be needed to complete the presentation.

The team was going to start looking at people's brains in a more direct way, which would involve looking at their brains in more direct ways. They were planning to do this in the near future. The team was also going to look at the more recent stuff about the kicking, which was discussed in more detail.

The team discussed the current state of their work on mirror neurons and their plans to look at people's brains in a more direct way. The team also talked about the construction of their Bayes-net and how it would interact with other metonyms and metaphors. They also discussed the kicking phenomenon, which they were planning to test in the future.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about the user interface design.

The user interface designer introduced three concepts in the user interface - Google controller, fancy controller, and intelligent controller. The three meant that the product would be simple but powerful, attractive and recognizable, and loaded with speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology. The first two were approved by the project manager, but the last one was seriously questioned. After a lot of discussions, the group finally decided to mix the Google controller and fancy controller with some simple vocal commands.

The User Interface Designer presented three concepts in the user interface design. The first one was a Google controller, the second was a fancy controller, and the last one was an intelligent controller. The user interface should give the customers the impression that their controller was very attractive and they could easy recognize it among a lot of products. The second concept was a combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions. The third concept was intelligent.

The user interface designer presented three concepts of the user interface design. The first one was a Google controller, the second was a fancy controller, and the last one was an intelligent controller. The user interface should be easy to use, but with sophisticated functions. The second concept was to give the customers the impression that the controller was very attractive. The third was to be technologically innovative and to attract a lot of customers.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the user interface designer propose the concept of intelligent controller?

The user interface designer believed a controller with speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology would be convenient when you couldn't find it. More importantly, although the feature was not one hundred percent reliable, it was a feature to distinguish the new product from traditional ones. And there's not enough motivation for users to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller.

The user interface designer proposed the concept of intelligent controller because most of the people want to use the remote control to zap and zap between channels, so most people would not be able to use gestures to switch between channels. It would be convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface rather than use buttons because some time it would be very convenient to speak something such as voice or gesture interface than to use buttons.

The user interface designer proposed the concept of intelligent controller because most of the people wanted to use the remote control to zap between channels, so they would be bored after a while. Moreover, it was convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than to use buttons. With this advanced features, they could attract a lot of users.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the project manager disapprove of the concept of intelligent controller?

The project manager put forward that the speech recognition wouldn't work when several persons wanted to change the channel at the same time, and the cost would surely rise if adding the two technologies. In response to that, the user interface designer said they would just cooperate with some research institute and the vocabulary was limited, so it wouldn't cost much. Then the project manager posed the language problem. The user interface designer answered they would have some language adaptations so the product could be used by people from all countries. Finally, there were still problems with the microphone and camera that were necessary for the two technologies.

The project manager thought it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller. He thought that most of the people want to use the remote control to zap the TV and zap between channels instead of using speech recognition or gesture recognition because most people would be bored after a while. Also, he thought that voice recognition and gesture recognition were risky because people would get injuries because of the same gesture.

The project manager thought that most of the people wanted to use the remote control to zap between channels, so they would not be interested in the concept of intelligent controller. Moreover, the project manager believed that voice and gesture recognition would be risky for the users.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about product industrial design.

The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects —material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood instead of plastic to make the controller more fashionable and having buttons with LCD so that people could see the controller in dark. In terms of the alimentation, it would be good to have both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation. Considering that the product was supposed to be easy to use, the industrial designer thought some low level chip would be enough, which was agreed by the group.

Industrial Designer first showed the design of what was inside and what were the different component of the remote control. Then, the group discussed the material and the material of the product. The group decided to use wood as the material for the base and to have a spongy touch for the buttons. After that, they discussed whether to use LCD buttons or lighted buttons because it was fashion and it was related to how beautiful it was in the dark and in the darkness it would be easier to use. The team also discussed whether they should use voice recognition and gesture recognition because they could attract all the ecological consumers.

The group discussed the material of the remote control and the type of buttons. The group agreed to use wood as the material for the base, but they would have to find a nice shape for the wooden remote control. They also agreed to have a spongy touch for the buttons because it was fashion and it would not fit with the wooden design. The team also discussed whether to use LCD buttons or lighted buttons because they were fashionable and it was related to how beautiful it was in the dark.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the group decide to use both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation when discussing the industrial design?

With the solar energy alimentation, people in remote areas could recharge the controller more conveniently. Plus, it might attract some ecologists to purchase. Although the design would increase the production cost, it would be added value that can be compensated.

The group decided to use both the classical battery and the solar energy alimentation because it would attract all the ecological consumers and it would be an added value to the remote control. Besides, it could attract more eco-friendly consumers.

The group agreed to use both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation when discussing the industrial design. The solar energy would attract all the ecological consumers because it would be an added value to the remote control, which would attract more people to buy it. The battery would add a little bit of the price, but it would not be something that would increase the price of production more.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the decision of discussion about the material when talking about industrial design?

The group decided to use wood partly instead of plastic because they wanted to put fashion in electronics and wood was a good option. By contrast, the plastic material was more common, impersonal, and not so high class as wood.

Industrial Designer thought wood would not fit with the wooden design because it would be too resistant to the spongy point of view, but rubber would be a special high class high-tech high-end material. Project Manager agreed with Industrial Designer that rubber was a good choice because it was not too hard to use and it could be correlated to energy, solar energy and the environment.

Industrial Designer proposed that the material should be spongy, but the problem was which kind of material do you need to to be the case. Project Manager preferred wood because it was very resistant and the feeling was natural. Industrial Designer also proposed that they could have both wood and some rubber for the buttons. However, Project Manager pointed out that the rubber would not fit with the wooden design so they could try to do something with wood.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about user requirements.

The marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis. Users would like to have a fancy look and feel rather than a functional one. Apart from that, they still wanted the product to be technologically innovative. At the same time, being user-friendly was also important. Then the group discussed how to make these requirements into practice.

User requirements were mainly about fancy look and feel, technologically innovative, easy to use, and easy to learn. They also wanted it to be easy-to-use. They wanted to have a spongy touch, and they wanted the remote control to be able to be used without any object.

The first point was that the user really wanted a fancy look and feel. The second point was they still wanted it to be technologically innovative, so maybe it was related to what Marketing had said with the speech recognition and so on. The third point was it was important that it was easy to use. The fourth point was to have a spongy touch.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the marketing recommend to do when discussing the problem of fashion?

That year everything from clothes to shoes and furniture was inspired by fruits and vegetables so the marketing suggested taking that into account. The marketing also mentioned that people wanted a spongy touch which meant the product might be partly wooden and partly rubber-made.

The marketing recommended to take the fashion trend into account when designing the remote control. For one thing, fancy look and feel was the most important one, followed by technologically innovative and easy to use. For another, fruit and vegetables were the most popular fruits and vegetables in the market this year, so they should take this into account for the design of the product.

The marketing recommended to do a short anal analysis of the remote control market and to have a better overview of what's the fashion in general. The market showed that everything from clothes to shoes and furniture was inspired by fruits and vegetables this year, so the marketing suggested to take this into account for the design of the product. Also, the marketing mentioned that people wanted fancy look and feel, technologically innovative and easy to use.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the decision of the discussion about fulfilling user requirements?

To meet the requirements of being fashionable and spongy, the group decided to use wood and rubber to make the controller. Maybe the part that users touched, such as the buttons, would be rubber, and the rest would be wooden, which would feel natural.

The group agreed that the remote control should be technologically innovative, easy to use and easy to find. The group also agreed that it should have a fancy look and feel and be spongy. However, there were still some disadvantages with the voice recognition and gesture recognition, so the group decided to focus on the intelligent controller instead.

The team decided that the remote control should be technologically innovative and easy to use. The team also agreed to have a fancy look and feel because it was what the users really wanted. However, the team did not agree to have voice recognition and gesture recognition because they thought it would be risky.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the presentation on the market trend.

Marketing gave the presentation on the remote control market. Marketing suggested that the first most important aspect of remote controls should be with a fancy look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel. And the second most important aspect was that a remote control should be technologically innovative. Lastly, Marketing suggested the spongy material and colour fronts.

Marketing first gave a brief overview of the market trend. The most important aspect for the remote control market was fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel, so it was very important for them to create something new. The second most important feature was that a remote control should be technological innovative, so they should use some of the new technology to be innovative. The third one was the aspect of easy to use.

Marketing presented on the market trend of fancy look-and-feel and technological innovation. The most important aspect for remote controls was fancy look and feel, instead of the current functional look. The second most important feature was that the remote control should be technological innovative. The third one was the aspect of easy to use. The team decided not to make use of LCD or speech recognition.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Marketing think of making spongy remote when presenting the market trend?

When User Interface asked the group how to make the spongy remote, Marketing thought about changeable fronts and some basic colour fronts because a fancy look was the most important thing for remote control. So they could make five different fronts to start with. Marketing also mentioned that it could be round, different from a normal remote control.

Marketing thought that a fancy look was the most important thing for remote control, so the feel of material was expected to be spongy and the shape of the remote control should be different. However, he thought it would be annoying for older people because they drop their remote control very often on the ground.

Marketing thought that fancy look was the most important thing for remote control, so the feel of material was expected to be spongy. However, it was still for older people because they still had older people.

==================================================
==================================================
What did User Interface recommend to do when discussing the technology innovation and why?

User Interface recommended the speech recognition when Marketing asked how to do with technological innovation because User Interface knew from the technology department that they had done research about it and recommended using speech. And User Interface would also check with the technology department on how to do that.

User Interface recommended that the team should go more to the iPod and M-P three players to create a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel of the remote control. Also, they should use LCD as well as speech recognition.

User Interface recommended to make the remote control more modern with fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look and feel. The remote control should be made of soft with primary colours like green, blue, red, and flashy colours, and the shape should be round in shape. Also, it should be easy to use and easy to learn.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about remote control features.

The group decided to have the normal batteries, the scroll wheel with rubber buttons together with back-lights, the beeping of the home station, the round shape as well as the speech recognition with an advanced chip. And they would skip the LCD because they would need the most expensive chip if they used an LCD.

Marketing suggested that fancy look-and-feel was the most important aspect for remote control, instead of the current functional look and feel, so it was important for them to create something new. Also, fancy stands for an original look and interface. The second most important feature was that a remote control should be technological innovative, so they should use some of the new technology to be innovative. The third one was the aspect of easy to use.

The group agreed that the remote control should be fancy with an original look-and-feel instead of the current functional look and feel. They also decided that they would not make use of LCD or speech recognition because they were aiming at a young public.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Project Manager think of the shape of the remote when discussing the remote and the recharger contact?

Marketing and User Interface suggested the group could choose the shape of the remote either like an iPod square or a more innovative round shape. Project Manager thought they should choose a round shape with rounded corners, instead of looking like an iPod so that would be more innovative.

Project Manager thought that the shape of the remote control should be round and not square, so that it would only look like the old remote controls and not like the iPod. Also, it should not be too big or too small, and it should be more rounded.

Project Manager thought that the shape of the remote should be more rounded so that it would not look like an iPod remote control, but more like the old remote controls. Project Manager also suggested that the remote control could be made in a round shape.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the conclusion about choosing a regular chip or an advanced chip inside the speech recognition when discussing the remote features?

Marketing emphasized on the importance of technology innovation. So Project Manager suggested putting the speech recognition in the remote directly and they would need an advanced chip. The group agreed on it and Industrial Designer supplemented that the division had developed a new and inexpensive speech recognition feature: the integrated programmable sample sensor, indicating that the cost would not be too much.

Industrial Designer thought that the chip could be simple, regular or advanced, but the advanced chip was more expensive than all the other chips. So they decided not to put it in because it would be too difficult to implement. Project Manager thought the regular chip would be cheaper than the advanced one.

Industrial Designer thought the chip could be simple, regular or advanced, but the advanced chip was more expensive than all the other chips. Therefore, they decided not to put it in because it was too difficult.

==================================================
Summarize the discussion about petitions fraudulence, tax evasion, violence handling and their supervisory.

Mr. Dan Albas asked about the handling of fraudulence by the Canadian government but Right Hon. Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister, was saying that the government put giving support and help to Canadians in the first place. Then Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie questioned the reason why the government supported the profiteers for tax evasion when implementing the large employer emergency financing facility. However, Right Hon. Justin Trudeau thought they were making plans to help workers to survive this pandemic and was always their priority to overcome. Hon. Candice Bergen required that how they were dealing with unopened mail at Service Canada and put out a violence case that why the Liberals were making this gun illegal and What the purpose of banning this particular farm rifle was. It was demonstrated by Hon. Bill Blair that many Canadians were murdered by these guns which was their explanation of banning guns.

The committee members were concerned about the fraudulence, tax evasion, violence handling and their supervisory supervisory. The Minister of National Revenue introduced that they had to impose conditions on executive compensation, including a ban on tax evasion and tax avoidance through tax havens. They also wanted to make sure that they were aware of the situation the companies were in, and to tighten the screws on these companies.

The members of the committee were concerned about the financial fraudulence, tax evasion, violence handling and their supervisory. Hon. Bill Morneau introduced that there was no tolerance for tax evasion and tax avoidance, and the government would always be there to counter tax evasion. However, the opposition party argued that the Prime Minister had not confirmed that 200,000 applications had been flagged as potentially fraudulent and that the government should investigate every individual case of fraud and write them off. The opposition party also questioned about the large employer emergency financing facility, which would allow companies not to resort to tax evasion or tax avoidance through tax havens.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie mean by saying that the Prime Minister continued to support the profiteers?

Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie first asked the prime minister whether the government would outlaw what was immoral and then, put it precisely, made an example that a bank relocated its most profitable activities carried out in Canada and registered them in a subsidiary in the Bahamas, Barbados or another tax haven. Under this situation, the government might not consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in Canada and that was why Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie said that the Prime Minister continued to support the profiteers.

Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie was delighted to hear the Prime Minister say that there was no tolerance for tax avoidance. However, he quickly became disillusioned because it was more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. The five big Bay Street banks benefited from this, as did the big multinationals. There were no conditions that would allow the government to tighten the screws on profiteers.

Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie said that the Prime Minister continued to support the profiteers because it was more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. Companies that legally took advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes would have access to the large employer emergency financing facility. The five big Bay Street banks benefited from this, as did the big multinationals. There were no conditions that would allow the government to tighten the screws on profiteer. The government was always looking for ways to reduce costs for consumers. The priority was to help workers across the country who could lose their jobs or who had lost their jobs.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did Hon. Bill Blair support banning Iver Johnson?

First, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles, except for law enforcement and military purposes. And Hon. Bill Blair thought what their regulations said very clearly, was that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers in Canadian society.

Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) said that they worked very closely with the Canadian firearms program, with law enforcement and with their firearms verification to identify the makes, models and variants of nine rifles, all of which had in their earliest provenance a design for military use, for soldiers to use in combat. These were specifically used for hunting.

Hon. Bill Blair thought it was a great opportunity when the member opposite said what the police were saying. The Ontario police leaders said that they supported a prohibition on all military-designed rifles. They said, In our view, these weapons had no place in our communities and should be reserved for use by Canada's military and law enforcement.

Summarize the discussion about Government support for the elderly and for vulnerable people.

During the pandemic of Covid-19, the government should fix this gap so that the single parents and their children could get the support they need. Also, matching funds and adequate housing should be given to support the affected in Canada. In addition, the elderly, one of the highest risk populations, had obtained extra funding from the government. Besides, vulnerable people like the disabled could gain more funding support and workers affected by the pandemic could also gain support.

Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors) introduced a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for those eligible for GIS. This means there would be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time. Beyond this, the government announced $20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that would help seniorsfor example, to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Ms. Jenny Kwan mean by saying there was a gap between program making and its implementation?

Ms. Jenny Kwan gave an example that a single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19. She paid taxes on her spousal income, but she was not eligible for CERB. That meant a complicated program delivered by the government that left many people behind, and more importantly, there was no action reacting to it. So Ms. Jenny Kwan called for a fixation for this gap and proposed that matching funding and adequate housing should be arranged for those who were affected.

Ms. Jenny Kwan pointed out that the government had moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit. However, as the member pointed out, when one moves quickly and efficiently, there will be gaps, and that's why they've been working diligently to try to fill those gaps.

According to Jenny Kwan, there was a gap between program making and its implementation. Instead of providing a universal direct payment for all, the government had decided to implement a complicated program that left many people behind. The truth of the matter was that single parents and their children who depended on spousal support and child maintenance were not getting support. The Prime Minister must know that the money the federal government sent was deficient.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the Canadian government do to support the elderly.

As one of the highest risk populations, the elderly's costs had gone up. Many seniors who were facing extra dispensing fees were already carefully budgeting before the pandemic. It was so important that the government be there to support them. The government announced a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for seniors eligible for GIS. This meant there would be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time. Beyond this, they announced $20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that would help seniors to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected.

Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors) introduced additional measures today wherein they were introducing a one-time special payment for those who receive OAS. This means there would be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time. Beyond this, they announced $20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that would help seniorsfor example, to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected.

Summarize the discussion about Government support for energy resources and tourism and funding in green economy and small businesses.

Since Quebec was Canada's biggest producer of hydroelectricity, renewable energy sharing through an energy corridor was very essential for different areas in Canada. And as a hard-hit sector, tourism needed much support from the Canadian government. The government was going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada's tourist regions would be ready when the economy reopened. When it came to the green economy, the government now gave priority to the virus and making through this disaster. Also, they paid much attention to the small businesses and carried out measures to help them out.

Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages) introduced that the government would provide $2.5 million for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, to help the tourism sector and small businesses. However, the opposition party members pointed out that this amount would not be enough to cover the cost of the COVID-19 pandemic, so the Minister promised to provide more funding.

Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages) introduced that the government would provide $350 million to support the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, to help the tourism sector. However, it was challenged by Mr. Steven D'Entremont, a member of the Conservative Party of Canada, that the funding would not cover the cost of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Minister explained that the money would go to the energy resources and tourism sector, which was the pride of the Quebec nation.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the current situation of the tourism sector and what was the government going to do?

The current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of Canada's tourism industry. And the pain would be felt by thousands of Canadians, who would have to find new jobs in order to survive. Let's work together to find ways to get this hard-hit sector moving again. Many people had lost their jobs and needed assistance from the government. That was why they were here, providing a helping hand at this difficult time so they could come out the other side.

Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages) introduced that the government had had the opportunity to speak to my colleague Mr.d'Entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country, and particularly in the Atlantic region. In light of the new funding for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, the government would be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism industry to find ways to get this hard-hit sector moving again.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the Canadian government do to help small businesses out?

They shared the member's concern that small businesses be supported. That's why they've moved forward with a number of measures that are designed to be of assistance. With respect to rent support, they were encouraging landlords to support this measure. Obviously, rent and landlord-tenant relations were under provincial jurisdiction. At every opportunity Hon. Bill Morneau talked to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there. They would continue to support small businesses. It allowed for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75% of the rent. It was a sound program and would require the provinces to step forward and enforce it.

Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages) introduced that the government had made changes to the CERB to make sure that people who run out of the fishers EI were eligible as well as seasonable workers. The government had also put in place measures to address processors' concerns so that harvesters continue to have a place to sell their product.

Summarize the discussion about things including fishing and tourism, oil and gas affected by the Covid-19.

During the pandemic, the lobster fishery was being negatively affected and was facing losses of up to 95% of its Asian markets. Many fishermen had their wives, their sons, their uncles or their fathers working for them, and sometimes it was the whole family on the boat. Moreover, the tourism season is already deeply affected by COVID-19. A number of industries, businesses and festivals were having to deal with considerable losses of income. As for oil and gas, western Canada oil storage is under extreme pressure. If thermal projects such as SAGD are shut down, those facilities could be lost forever. The oil and gas sector was suffering through two crises --COVID and the effects of a global price war.

The Covid-19 was already deeply affected by COVID-19. A number of industries, businesses and festivals were having to deal with considerable losses of income. The government had started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $62.5 million for processors, as well as to make sure that the CERB was available for seasonal workers and people who had run out of their fishery EI, but more needs to be done.

Mr. Chris d'Entremont asked about fishing and tourism, oil and gas affected by the Covid-19. The Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard answered that the government was looking at sector-specific areas to make sure that the issues were addressed. However, the opposition party argued that most fishermen were not eligible for the wage subsidy program due to the stipulation that it could not be used for employees who were related to their employer.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the government do to help the fishing industry?

The fish and seafood sector had been extremely adversely affected because of COVID-19. They've started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $62.5 million for processors, as well as to make sure that the CERB is available for seasonal workers as well as people who had run out of their fishery EI, but they knew that more needs to be done. The fishery enterprises were uniquely structured, which was why they were looking at measures to address the concerns they had. Because of the unique structure of fishing enterprises, they were not eligible for many of the supports they had put in place. They had made changes to the CERB to make sure that people who ran out of the fishers EI were eligible as well as seasonal workers.

Hon. Bernadette Jordan introduced that the government had started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $62.5 million for processors, as well as to make sure that the CERB was available for seasonal workers and people who had run out of their fishery EI, but more needs to be done. The fishery enterprises were uniquely structured, which was why they were looking at measures to address concerns they had.

==================================================
What did the stress faced by oil and gas?

The oil and gas industry was under severe strain. Over the past number of years, they had seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down. The federal Liberal government's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the Bill C-69, which would prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada; and the oil shipping ban, Bill C-48, for the northern coast of British Columbia, which also had a negative effect on the oil industry. These two bills alone pushed over $200 billion of investment out of Canada, causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels. To compound Alberta's economic problems, we have an international oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a huge drop in demand for oil.

The oil and gas industry was facing a lot of stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government had to make sure that it was taking all the necessary steps to ensure that the industry was able to continue to operate in a safe and healthy environment.

The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness introduced that the government was aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies that Canada needed, from a diverse range of suppliers around the world and here at home. The government was working directly with businesses across the country to rapidly scale up domestic production capacity to meet current and future needs. However, the opposition party questioned about the lack of personal protective equipment for the workers. The minister explained that they were working in an incredibly difficult and competitive global environment and were procuring millions of items: face shields, gowns, hand sanitizer, and N95 surgical masks, and ventilators every single day. They were targeting support to some of the most critical challenges facing the food supply chain.

Summarize the discussion about product appearance.

The user interface designer put forward that the basic colour would be red and yellow and there would be two basic shapes - circle and triangle, which was called a mushroom design. Specifically, the prototype had 3 key features - a fuzzy look, a spherical channel selection and a stable triangle base. However, the marketing thought mushroom was not in the trends so the group decided to change it into a pineapple.

Industrial Designer thought the shape of the remote control was unique and looked like a pineapple, so they decided to call it a pineapple. User Interface thought the colour was pretty and the shape was good, so the team decided to give it a fancy look and feel. However, the team was not so happy about the shape because it was too much red and there were too many buttons. They decided to reduce the number of buttons and make the shape less smooth so that it would be easier to use.

The product was made by clay and yellow with a pineapple shape. The colour was yellow and red, and the shape was a mushroom with two basic shapes, a circle and a triangle piece. The shape was unique and the colour was bright yellow and green. The material of the product was a combination of wood and plastic, and it was made with a yellow-red colour and yellow-green material. There was a microphone array embedded inside the remote control, and there were two functions: circle channel selection and voice recognition. The remote control was easy to use and convenient to use. It was not a long-life product because it was not like the traditional one.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the user interface think the basic colour should be yellow and red when talking about the product appearance?

Because yellow was their company colour and red was more attractive, which met the product requirement that the remote control should have a fancy look to attract the customers.

The user interface thought the basic colour was yellow and red because it was the company colour, and yellow was more attractive than red. Also, yellow was their company colour. Therefore, they could turn everything in either yellow or black.

The user interface thought the basic colour should be yellow and red because yellow was the company colour and red was more attractive.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the marketing disagree with the user interface designer on the shape of the product when discussing product appearance?

In the user interface designer's design, the shape of the product and the buttons were all mushrooms, but the marketing thought mushroom was not in the trends because mushroom was neither a vegetable nor a fruit.

The marketing thought that the shape of the product was too much red and the colour was not in the trend, so the user interface designer should make some changes to make it look more like a pineapple with cherry on top. Also, the marketing believed that the product would not last for ten years because it was not a long-life product.

The marketing thought that the shape of the product was not obvious because it was not like the traditional remote controls that people could put in their pocket or in their jacket. The marketing also pointed out that the product would not last for ten years because fruit and vegetables were not in the trends.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about product evaluation.

The marketing suggested measuring how good the design was instead of just talking about it so the group started to judge the design in three aspects on a scale of one to seven, one being true and seven being false. The criterion was how fancy, technologically innovative, and easy-to-use the remote control was and it got three, two, and four in separate aspects, which meant it was acceptable.

Marketing first gave three key points to the design of the remote control. The first one was fancy look and feel. The second one was technological innovation. The third one was technologically technologically in innovative. The last one was easy to use.

Firstly, the group discussed the fancy look and feel of the remote control, the shape of the product, the colour, the material, the microphone array, and the material of the material. Then, the team discussed the material and the energy source. The team agreed that the material would be plastic and the shape would be made by clay. The group also discussed the cost of the production, which would be 12.5 Euros. Finally, they agreed to add some features to the product.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the group think the design was technologically innovative?

The controller had an embedded microphone array which could recognise simple vocal commands and the four microphones could capture voice from different directions. It also had tactile buttons, which was a really good point.

The group thought the remote control was technologically innovative because it had a microphone array embedded in the core, which could capture voice from different directions. Also, the group thought it would be interesting for the marketing team to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be able to sell it.

The group thought the remote control was technologically innovative because there was a microphone array embedded in the core and the group could capture voice from different directions. Also, the group thought it would be interesting for the marketing team to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be able to sell it.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the marketing and the industrial designer disagree with the user interface designer when judging whether the controller was easy to use?

The user interface designer thought it was easier than a traditional controller because you didn't have to press a button, just turn the ball to a certain angle to select channels. However, the marketing and the industrial designer thought it was quite difficult because users didn't know the angle was the correct one and they had to go through all the channels if they wanted to jump from channel one to twenty.

The marketing and the industrial designer disagreed with the user interface designer when judging whether the controller was easy to use. They thought that it was hard to turn things to change channels because the remote control had only one button, so it would be hard to control the scale. Also, they thought that the microphone array embedded in the controller would make it difficult to use, so they would have to design a different way to use it.

The marketing and the industrial designer thought that the remote control was easy to use because there was a microphone array embedded and there were tactile buttons. However, the user interface designer pointed out that the turning from the base was difficult because it depended on the angle you turned.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about industrial design and quotation.

The group decided that the product would have a low level chip, one button with LCD, a scroll wheel with a push button on it, a battery in the base, a single curve, and solar cells and it would be plastic instead of wooden so that the costs were 12.5 Euros which was within the budget. Furthermore, they came up with some new ideas about future products, such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable TV that followed the trend and people's moods.

Industrial Designer thought the remote control would be easy to use because it would have a fancy look and feel and a unique design. User Interface thought it would be easier to use than traditional controller because it had a circle channel selection and a button to select the channel. Project Manager thought the colour of the product would be bright yellow and the shape would be like a pineapple with a yellow centre and a yellow and red centre. The group agreed on the colour, shape, material, buttons, and the material of the case. They also agreed to use solar cells as the energy source.

The group had a discussion about the industrial design of the remote control. First, the group discussed the shape of the product, the colour, the material, the buttons, the microphone array, and the material of the case. Then, they talked about the material used for the case, the shape, the color, the function, the size, the number of buttons and the energy source. After that, they discussed the cost of the prototype, which was twelve fifty Euros. The group agreed to have a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and a half Euros. Then they discussed whether the product would be easy to use, technologically innovative, and easy to sell. Finally, they decided to make the product with a fancy look and feel and incorporate the fruit and vegetable theme.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the group decide to keep the solar cells when discussing the industrial design?

Although solar cell was the most expensive part of the whole product, it still played a crucial role in making the controller technologically innovative. Plus, it would be interesting for their marketing team to make a lot of advertisements to sell it.

The group decided to keep the solar cells because it would be interesting for the marketing team to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be able to sell it. Also, the group thought that the cost of solar cells was too expensive, so they would not need to redesign the product.

When discussing the number of solar cells in each ball, the group agreed that three solar cells would be enough. However, the cost of the solar cells was too expensive, so the group decided to keep the single simple chip on print instead.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the industrial designer disagree with the marketing when talking about some new ideas about future products?

The marketing thought they should not trust too much the trend because it wouldn't last long - fruits and vegetables were in fashion this year but maybe next year it would be insects. However, the industrial designer believed it was good to follow the flow now and then since electronic devices were not long life products: if people changed, the product appearance should change as well.

The industrial designer was not so happy about the fruit shape because it was not in the trend. The marketing thought that the product would not last for ten years because fruit and vegetables would last for only two years, so it would not be a long-life product. The industrial designer thought it would be better to follow the flow and make the product now and after if the people changed their mind, then change also the product.

The industrial designer thought that the shape of the remote control was too much red and that it would not last for ten years. Besides, the shape was not like the traditional one because it was flat, so the shape would be boring. Also, the marketing pointed out that the product would not be fashionable because it lacked the fruit and vegetable look.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group discuss about remote control style and design optimization?

Industrial Designer desired to integrate remote controls for different appliances into one. Marketing pointed out that such integration would lead to too many buttons, which was not user-friendly enough. Instead, Marketing suggested that a menu display should be incorporated. Project Manager and User Interface agreed and added that basic buttons could remain. User Interface and Industrial Designer refused the flip top, however, for it costs a lot. The team temporarily chose lightweight plastic to be the material.

Industrial Designer thought that the remote control should be made of lightweight plastic so that it would save space and reduce the number of unnecessary buttons. User Interface suggested that they could integrate everything into one remote control so that users could use all the ones at the same time. Project Manager thought that they should keep it down to a black and white LCD thing anyway, which would make it cheaper. Marketing thought that it should be user-friendly to everyone.

Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control could have an extra button that could be pressed for large print like in large print books so that it could be more user-friendly for the older generation. Project Manager pointed out that they could still use plastic because it was easily moulded and produced. However, the group agreed that they should keep it down to a black and white LCD.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did the group decide to incorporate a menu display when discussing remote control style and design optimization?

Marketing believed that most of the market would want convenient channel browsing and volume adjustment features instead of any tampering or programming with too many buttons. User Interface agreed with the simplification of symbols. The team came up with a menu display to make the remote more user-friendly.

On a mobile phone, you can press a key and it gives you a menu display, which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do. On a remote control, people might find it easier to browse and navigate.

On a mobile phone, you can press a key and it gives you a menu, it's got a menu display, and people might find it easier to browse and navigate. On a remote control, instead of having too many buttons and making it complicated for the user, may have an LCD display or something like that, like a mobile.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Industrial Designer think of the older generation when discussing remote control style and design optimization?

Industrial Designer initially worried about the replacement of buttons. Industrial Designer was soon convinced by Marketing that the age gap was a problem regardless of any design modifications and insisted on the incorporation of a menu display, however.

Industrial Designer thought that the older generation would have to keep the remote control down to a black and white LCD thing anyway, as long as they can read it and can work out what everything's doing.

Industrial Designer thought that for the older generation, they would have to keep it down to a black and white LCD thing anyway.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Industrial Designer think of plastic when discussing remote control style and design optimization?

Industrial Designer was uncertain about whether the remote could look fashionable with plastic at first. Marketing and Project Manager exemplified other remote controls to make Industrial Designer believe that silver plastic could look smart.

Industrial Designer thought that there was no reason to make the remote control look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone, because it could still be lightweight plastic. Industrial Designer also thought that using plastic did not make it cheaper.

Industrial Designer thought that the remote control could still be made of plastic because it was easily moulded and produced.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about price issues and target groups of remote control.

Project Manager proposed to price each remote control at 25 Euros, considering the 12.5-Euro production cost. The profit aim for the team would be 50 million Euros in the first year. The market range would be international and over all age groups.

Industrial Designer thought that one point four Euro would make a good selling price, but Project Manager pointed out that half of the selling price was taken up by building the remote control, so the profit aim was fifty million Euros in the first year. User Interface suggested that they could lower the price to make the product look a cheapie-cheapie option. However, Project Manager thought that it would depend on whether they wanted to undercut the price.

Project Manager announced that the remote control would be priced at 25 Euros and produced at a cost of 17.5 Euros. The profit aim was 50 million Euros in the first year.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Project Manager think of the market range when discussing price issues and target groups of the remote control?

Project Manager hoped to make the market range international, covering all age groups, instead of focusing solely on the business market. Project Manager highlighted that the team should not worry about the language differences and the big target group would be achievable.

Project Manager thought that it was not a case of worrying about different languages and things like that, making that a key point. The target group of the remote control should be user-friendly to everyone, so that it would be accessible and usable by all age groups. The profit aim was fifty million Euros in the first year.

Project Manager mentioned that the market range was international and it had to be accessible and usable by all age groups. Project Manager did not want to worry about different languages and things like that.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group discuss about battery issues and flip top design?

On battery issue, Industrial Designer expressed a desire to minimize the size of the battery. Meanwhile, cost, power consumption, wireless range and data transmission were supposed to be considered. User Interface's presentation followed. The remote control design would be simplified and user-friendly. To make the style more trendy, User Interface decided on a flip-top model.

Industrial Designer thought that most controls used some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use, wireless and you don't need to send very much information. Project Manager thought that the triple A batteries were small and easy to carry, but Industrial Designer was not sure whether they should look at something else so they could shrink down the size of the control. Industrial Designer suggested that they could use rechargeable batteries, which would be cheaper in the long run.

Industrial Designer suggested that they could look at the size issue because most of the remote controls were powered by triple A batteries but those can be quite bulky so they could shrink down the size of the control. Project Manager agreed and asked Industrial Designer if they could get the sort of circular round ones but Industrial Designer was just wondering about power consumption.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Industrial Designer think of triple A batteries when discussing battery issues and flip top design?

Industrial Designer admitted that current remote controls were mostly powered by triple A batteries. However, Industrial Designer also pointed out that they were bulky, although they had been the smallest fit-in batteries at present. Industrial Designer expressed a desire to find a smaller alternative for triple A batteries.

Industrial Designer thought that most remote controls used some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use, wireless and you don't need to send very much information. The triple A batteries were the smallest you could get and they would last quite a long time.

Industrial Designer thought that most remote controls were quite chunky and that the size of the batteries had to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about market research and adjustments due to new project requirements.

The market research presented by Marketing implicated that the remote control design was expected to be more stylish and less complicated. Project Manager added that an ideal model would be for TV only and have a corporate logo incorporated. To meet the requirements above, Industrial Designer recommended a touch screen panel. Marketing suggested that the remote control size could be adjusted due to physical differences among international users. The team gave up speech recognition, for it would cost a lot. An alarm would be incorporated for detection in case the remote control was lost in the house.

Marketing first presented the market research findings from the marketing point of view and found that seventy-five percent of users found most remote controls ugly. Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy, and a high proportion of the international target group were prepared to spend more for something that's a bit nicer looking. Marketing also found that most people only used about ten percent of the buttons on the remote control, so it had obvious design implications there. Marketing suggested that they could cut down on the number of functions and reduce the size of the control. They could also cut back on the cost if they didn't have so many functions.

Marketing firstly presented the market research findings. Seventy five percent of users found most remote controls ugly. Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Most people only used about ten percent of the buttons, so it had obvious design implications. Also, fifty percent of remote controls only used ten percent or less, so there was a big design issue there.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did Industrial Designer think of incorporating an alarm when discussing market research and adjustments due to new project requirements?

The market research implicated that users' biggest frustration was their failure in finding the remote control once it was lost in the house. To solve the problem, Industrial Designer suggested that a button could be added on the TV; when the user pressed the button, the remote control would beep to let the user know its location. Meanwhile, such a solution would be within budget.

Industrial Designer thought that it would be quite expensive to incorporate an alarm because it would probably cost quite a lot of money, so he thought that they could take a cheaper option which still did the same thing.

Industrial Designer thought that it would be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they paid lip service in the instruction manual but it was not that great anyway.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did Industrial Designer think of physically different designs when discussing market research and adjustments due to new project requirements?

Industrial Designer was inspired by the design of Xbox and gave an example of Japanese people's small hands compared to the big controller. Out of ergonomic considerations, Industrial Designer encouraged the team to notice the physical differences among users all over the world when deciding the remote control size.

Industrial Designer thought that people in Japan wouldn't buy two different sized controllers because the controller was physically to big and they had smaller hands. So they couldn't get round the controller which was why they could have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others.

Industrial Designer thought that if they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big, they couldn't get round the controller because they had smaller hands. So they could have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others.

==================================================
==================================================
What's the conclusion of the remote control style when discussing market research and adjustments due to new project requirements?

Overall, the model style was expected to be trendy and appealing. Marketing and Project Manager agreed on User Interface's design of a flip-screen. Marketing also hoped that the remote control would be slightly curved. User Interface added that the remote control would curl up to users' hands so that their thumbs did not have to press. The corporate logo would be put in the corner. The model would be made of lightweight plastic with a smooth bottom and a nice scallop shell exterior.

The market research found that seventy five percent of users found most remote controls ugly and seventy-five percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Eighty percent of the international target group preferred a fancy looking remote control, which meant that a high proportion of them were willing to pay more money for something that's a bit nicer looking. The market research also found that most people only used about ten percent of buttons, so it had obvious design implications there. The remote control should be user-friendly by being easy to use.

The team reached the conclusion that the remote control should be user-friendly by being easy to use, rather than having a lot of complex buttons. The main functions such as volume control or channel changing should be on the top and the complex functions which are often used, such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a wide range of people should be put in the middle part of the flip-top.

==================================================
What was the general discussion of the meeting?

A pressing concern for the group is the DARPA meeting in July, which is only a short time away, and for which they would like to have some progress. PLP results for the front-end look good, with the group also reporting progress in segmentation: Thilo's segmenter will now be used and ways of improving performance investigated; The classifier segmentation is progressing well, especially in the use of prosody for identifying interruption. Work on the front end continues, with improvements of 3-5% being made.

The meeting was mainly about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting transcripts. The team was working on the transcriptions for the upcoming DARPA meeting, which is expected to be in mid-July. There was a lot of discussion about how to improve the quality of the data and how to make the data more robust. They also discussed how they could improve the performance of their models by adding more information to the data, such as the size of the Gaussian system and optimizing the weights.

The meeting was primarily about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting transcripts. The team discussed the progress of the transcriptions and the progress on the task of segmentation. The professor informed the team of the DARPA meeting in July and the plan to move the task into production mode, which would allow the team to train their models on automatic segmentations. There was also some discussion about how the team could further improve the performance of their model, which was still not performing as well as they would like it to.

==================================================
==================================================
What was decided on DARPA?

A pressing concern for the group is the DARPA meeting in July, which is only a short time away, and for which they would like to have some progress. 

DARPA was going to have a meeting in the middle of July to discuss the transcriptions for distribution. The team was excited about the prospect of meeting with DARPA. They had already done some preliminary work on the transcripts and were looking forward to the meeting.

DARPA would like to see the transcriptions in production mode by the middle of July. The team agreed that they should send them to the meeting in July to get the approval they need to be ready for distribution. The meeting will be held in Washington, DC.

==================================================
==================================================
What was said on transcripts?

For the DARPA meeting in July, the group proposed that they should have the question answering mock-up and transcriber interface ready for then, and also have data available.

Transcribers are working on a subset of meeting data that is ready to be transcribed and will be available for distribution in July. The team is working on the finalization of the data, which is expected to take about two to three weeks.

Transcribers have transcribed sixty-two hours of meetings so far and are in the process of being edited. The team is working on further reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting data, which will allow the team to keep the data more easily available to the public.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the status of transcription?

The final english SmartKom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised.

Transcribers have continued to work past set one and have gotten five meetings done in that set, but they are in the process of being edited. The team is still doing some final-pass editing, trying to convert the data over to the master file as the being the channelized version.

The team has transcribed a total of sixty-two hours of meetings so far. The average number of speakers per meeting is six and the duration of the meeting is 16 minutes. The transcriptions are in the process of being edited and will be sent to ICSI for further processing.

What change has occurred to the segmenter?

Segmentation for the recogniser has been done by hand which the group consider "cheating", instead now they want to use Thilo's automatic segmenter.

The segmenter has been performing well, and the team is looking forward to moving to automatic segmentation. The team was concerned that they were cheating by having the hand-segmentations as the basis of the recognition, so they would like to move onto automatic segmentations.

The segmenter has been re-configured to use the same configuration as the standard system, which means that it is performing as well as it did before. The team is also working on tuning the size of the Gaussian system and adapting the models for background noise to the environment.

==================================================
==================================================
What is the status of the segmenter

The classifier segmentation work is going well, but needs more data to improve results since non-native speaker data cannot be used.

The segmenter is performing well and is improving. The team has hired two more transcribers and is working on a subset of the data that is ready to go into production mode.

The segmenter is performing well. The team is sending data to ICSI to generate a chunked file that will be sent to the DARPA meeting in July.

==================================================
==================================================
What change has occurred to the segmenter?

To improve the performance of Thilo's automatic segmenter, this is going to be retrained and adapted to run with Thilo's posteriors and speaker background models.

Summarize the discussion on deletions and improving the net

Adding the neural net was doubling the number of deletions. The model did not improve significantly, however, thought it became better at some tasks. The results were a mixed basket and it was decided that further experimentation was necessary.

The team was concerned that the model was not performing well. The professor suggested that the team should focus on improving the net. The team thought that they could improve the model by adding more features to the model. They also wanted to look at how the noise subtraction was subtracting off speech, which was causing the model to perform worse.

The professor thought that the team should focus on improving the net. The team had noticed that the number of deletions in the HM case had doubled and that the model was not performing as well as they expected it to. The professor suggested that they could improve the model by adding more features to the feature set.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the professor think about the neural net?

The professor was interested in knowing what impact the neural net had in the older models which did not have pure features. The professor believed it was worthwhile to improve the net, though he also expressed that nets were occasionally over used.

The professor thought that the team was doing well with the model, but that the model was not performing as well as expected. He thought the team should focus on improving the model. The professor thought it would be interesting to see what would happen if they just had the neural net without the side thing.

The professor thought that the team was getting better recognition with the neural net, but the model was still not performing as well as it could. The professor thought the team should focus on improving the net.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the team discuss about the most noisy cases?

The team thought that the most noisy cases were the distant microphone testing. That is when there were non-stationary noises in the background, like from a car, a babble or subway. These presented a unique challenge for the model that could potentially be best solved with a neural net.

The team thought that the most noisy cases were the distant microphone for testing and close microphone for close mike training. The team also noticed that the TIMIT noises were sort of a range of noises and they were not so much the stationary driving kind of noises, but the ambient noise was pretty different.

The team thought that the most noisy cases were the distant microphone for testing and the TIMIT noises. The team also wanted to know if the noise subtraction was subtracting off speech. The professor thought that it was possible that the noise compensation was treating some things differently.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion on VAD results

The VAD neural net had twelve times nine inputs and two outputs. The system had improved significantly. It added some latency but the team could potentially run it in parallel.

The team thought that the VAD was doing well, but the latency was too large. The team was concerned that the model was not performing as well as they expected it to. The professor thought that they were getting better recognition, but not as good as they had hoped. The VAD had a sixty-two percent error rate reduction on the clean version of the utterances, which was better than the previous VAD.

PhD C informed the team that the features that the VAD neural network used were MFCC after noise compensation. The VAD was using nine frames of six features from C-zero to C-five, plus the first derivatives, and it had one hundred hidden units. The model had twelve times nine inputs and two outputs. The latency was two hundred and twenty milliseconds.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the professor think about VAD latency?

The professor wanted to know how much latency the VAD was adding to the model. The professor thought that the process could work in parallel. The professor informed the team that the max latency was unknown.

The professor thought that the VAD latency was too large. The VAD was used for on-line normalization, and it was used before the delta computation. The delta was two hundred and twenty milliseconds, which was a lot of time. The professor thought the team should not worry too much about it.

The professor thought that the VAD was used for on-line normalization, and it was used before the delta computation. The lag was two hundred milliseconds. The professor was concerned that the lag was too large.

==================================================
==================================================
What did PhD C say about the breakdown of the latency?

PhD C explained that the silence probabilities had a 100ms delay, the delta at the input had a 40ms delay, and a 10ms delay was created by LDA filters.

PhD C explained that the latency of the VAD was two hundred and twenty milliseconds. The VAD is used for on-line normalization, and it's used before the delta computation. The delta computation was done afterwards. The neural network used nine frames for cleaning of the speech, which added forty milliseconds to the latency.

PhD C informed the team that the VAD was used for on-line normalization, and it was used before the delta computation. The delta added forty milliseconds for cleaning of the speech, and another ten milliseconds for the LDA filter.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group discuss about the current trend and potential materials?

Marketing proposed that the fancy look and feel were more important than the functionality of the product. The fruit and vegetable theme was the current trend, and marketing himself preferred fruits to vegetables. Therefore, how spongy the material could be should be taken into consideration when choosing the materials. The potential materials to accomplish the fruit and vegetable theme could be a sort of rubber, which was used in the stress balls. The alternative option was to use a cover for it, and choose a colour that fits one's sitting room.

Marketing had been searching the current trends in electronics, both on the web and via fashion-watchers, and the findings were that the first thing to aim for was a fancy look and feel, followed by technologic technology and the innovations to do with that. The second thing was the easy to use factor. The third was the spongy feel. The last thing was to make the remote look like a fruit instead of a vegetable.

Marketing informed the team that the fruit and vegetable theme is the current trend in electronics. The team agreed that they should go for that if they want to go for fashion. The group also discussed the material of the remote control, including rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. The material should be limited to spongy because Marketing thought people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the Industrial Designer say about component design?

Industrial Designer thought some parts needed custom design, and other parts should just use standard. For example, the case needed custom design to protect the remote and the locator, and the circuit board needed custom design as well, while the buttons and the wheels, radio sender and receiver were all standard parts. In addition, beeper or other noise things were needed as well for locating the remote. Rubber, plastic, wood and titanium were options of materials, but better not titanium. Regular chips were required if the iPod-style wheel button was used.

Industrial Designer said that they would be custom designing the case, probably a hard plastic or some other material case to protect the remote and the locator, and they would need to custom desi design a circuit board, because the circuit board had to take the button input and send it to the output so they would have to design that each time. They would also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote. The infrared L_E_D was actually going to be included in their circuit board that came with it.

The Industrial Designer had been looking at the components design by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting. The Industrial Designer said that they would be custom designing their case, probably a hard plastic or some other material case to protect the remote and the locator. They would also need to custom design a circuit board, because the circuit board had to take the button input and send it to the output so they had to design that each time. They could use rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. The infrared L_E_D was actually gonna be included in the circuit boards that came with it.

==================================================
==================================================
What did people decide on screen usage when discussing the necessity of screen?

User Interface assumed they were going to have a screen at first, since User Interface thought a screen was necessary for people to visualize things such as a specific song when looking for one. However, since adding a screen cost more money, and TV could be used as the screen, they finally decided that screen was not necessary.

Industrial Designer thought that people would need a screen with music because they were looking for a specific song, like a specific band or whatever. User Interface thought that it would be silly to have a screen if people hardly used it. Project Manager thought that the screen would be better if people could scroll to get channels instead of using the wheel. Marketing thought that a wheel would be more expensive according to the design people.

Industrial Designer thought they needed a screen with music because users were looking for a specific song, like they know that band or whatever. User Interface thought it seemed silly to have a screen if users hardly used it. Project Manager thought it would be okay if users only needed to scroll to get channels. Marketing thought the screen would be better than a wheel because people could go back and forth and choose if they wanted to change the brightness of the television.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about potential options of energy.

Battery, solar power, dynamo, Kryptonite were potential options of the energy. They ended up with a preference on Kryptonite. Even though they could not find an exact price for it, it would not be more expensive than a chip.

The team had an option of batteries, solar power, and a dynamo. The dynamo would be interesting because the moment you move it, it creates energy on its own. Solar power was not available with the rubber case, so the team decided to use a wind-up or a kinetic thing where you had to wind it yourself. The team also discussed whether to use chips on print or chip on chip. The chip on print was more expensive than the regular chip, so they decided to buy in bulk.

The team discussed three options of energy: batteries, solar power, and a dynamo. Solar power was not available with the rubber case and the dynamo was a kinetic thing where you would basically have to wind it yourself. The dynamo would be interesting because the moment you moved it, it created energy on its own. However, Project Manager thought it seemed a little weird for a living room. The team then discussed the cost of the energy and decided to use batteries.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the Industrial Designer think of the potential options of energy?

Industrial Designer preferred battery. Industrial Designer was not very familiar with dynamo. Wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power were all possible, but solar power would not be available with the rubber case.

The Industrial Designer thought that solar power was not available with the rubber case and the dynamo was a kinetic thing where you had to wind it yourself. The dynamo would create energy on its own, so it would be a little weird for a living room anyways. He also thought that the chip on the chip was probably the most expensive part of the chip.

==================================================
==================================================
What was the cost of the Kryptonite when discussing potential options of energy?

The website did not give an actual cost, but most of the stuff was cheap. The chip would be the most expensive part anyway, so the group should not worry about the cost of the Kryptonite too much.

The cost of the Kryptonite was determined to be 25 cents per kilogram. The chip on print was probably the most expensive part of the chip, and the chip would be mass produced in bulk. The cost of solar power was not available with the rubber case and the dynamo was not suitable for a living room.

The cost of the Kryptonite was unknown because the Industrial Designer did not have enough data to give an exact cost. The chip was probably the most expensive part of the remote control, as it was stamped onto the chip and could be mass-produced. Also, some chips were more expensive than others.

==================================================
==================================================
What were the final decisions made by the team?

Kinetic charging will be adopted with LCD display on the top side of the flip top and rubberized buttons, such as volume control and channel control on the bottom. Two separate circuit boards will be joined by wires for standard and complex buttons respectively. Fruit and vegetable colours, such as chilli red or tomato red will be used for the rubber cover and the case will be plastic. The company logo will be incorporated into the design. The team hoped to incorporate voice recognition but financial feasibility will have to be checked and whistles or beepers could be used if not feasible.

The team decided to use a combination of plastic and rubber for the plastic shell, a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. They also decided to incorporate the image of the company into the design and incorporate the word "Fruit" into the name of the remote control. The team also agreed to have a G-U-I-I interface in the middle of the flip-top and to use rubber as a padding or for the grip.

The team finally reached a consensus on the final design of the remote control. They decided on a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. They also decided to use a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip. Also, they decided to incorporate the image of the company into the design. The team also agreed on the kinetic as the back-up battery and to have a remote control that could be in standby mode to save battery life. Finally, the team agreed on having a G-U-I interface in the middle of the flip-top.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the team decide on in the last meeting?

Teletext will not be used and there will not be a control for everything. The buttons should be easy to find. The image of the company is to be incorporated in the design and a flip design is decided. Voice recognition is left out. The shape of the remote will be different than normal, like a shell or something along those lines. An alarm will be added in case the remote is lost. The target market will be young business people.

The team decided on a combination of plastic and rubber shell, a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. They also decided to incorporate the image of the company into the design and incorporate the slogan of the remote control into it somehow. The team also agreed to use a kinetic battery for the battery and to incorporate voice recognition for the finding it.

The team decided on a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. They were going to use a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs and rubber as a padding or for the grip. The team also agreed on the kinetic as a back-up battery. They also decided to have a G-U-I interface in the middle of the flip-top.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about the feedback on the design of the remote control device.

Market research was done with a hundred subjects and Marketing concluded the most important aspect required in the device is a fancy look and feel. The second and third important aspects are technologically innovative and being easy to use. Fruits and vegetables can be taken into consideration when thinking about design themes as they were the themes of fashion fairs in Paris and Milan. There is also a trend towards a spongy feel to materials.

Marketing suggested that the market trend was fancy look and feel, rather than the current functional look, feel and feel of remote controls, and people also wanted a remote control to be technologically innovative and easy to use. User Interface suggested that they could take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, red chilli and yellow chilli, and the company logo. Industrial Designer proposed that the remote control could have a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. The group also discussed the battery life and the material of the case.

The team decided to use a flip design and a different shape from what's normal, a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs for the rubber cover, rubberised buttons on the bottom side, and the case itself was plastic. The team also decided to incorporate the image of the company into the design, such as the company logo and the shape of the remote control. They also agreed to have a G-U-I interface in the middle of the flip-top.

==================================================
==================================================
What are the actual components found in most remote controls that will be included in this remote design?

Industrial Designer explained that TA11835 is a chip used in pretty much every remote control to send out standard signals based on the input. On the other hand, most current remotes use a silicone printed circuit board (PCB board) which connects the circuits so that the messages would be sent to the chip. The size should be decided as the board can be custom made.

Most current remotes use a chip called T_A double one eight three five which sends out standard signals based on your input and it's pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the moment. The chip can be printed on the circuit board and the buttons can be made of rubber or plastic. There will be two types of buttons, one for volume and one for channel changing and the other one for the lower distance. Also, there will be an LCD screen on the remote control and a number of different types of switches.

The remote control would be made of plastic and rubber with a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. It would have an LCD screen on the top and rubberised buttons on the bottom. There would be two types of batteries, standard double A and triple A and they would be rechargeable. The remote controls would be in standby mode to conserve battery life so that it would not be used too much while not being used. The team would incorporate the image of the company into the design and it would be easy to find.

==================================================
==================================================
What are the benefits and drawbacks for each battery option mentioned and what did Industrial Manager suggest to conserve battery life when discussing the design and availability of actual components?

Standard AA and AAA are bulky but the cheapest. Dynamo and dual charging with normal batteries and solar charging take up too much space. Solar charging is the second cheapest but not resistant to dropping. Also, Project Manager believed it would limit the market. Kinetic charging is small and portable but market research should be done first. No rechargeable battery options were available. The remote could have a standby mode and the lights behind the buttons would be switched off after five or ten seconds when not in use.

Industrial Designer suggested that the standard double A and triple A batteries were too bulky at the moment and the dynamo charging was not very resistant to dropping, so they should be put on the case and the batteries would be smaller. Also, the kinetic charging would not last as long as the regular batteries, so it would be better to use the regular ones.

Industrial Designer suggested that double A and triple A batteries were too bulky at the moment, dynamo charging was not very resistant to dropping and it would detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion of the design of actual components regarding case material.

Titanium is too expensive, would be easily dented and could only do a standard box shape whereas plastic could be made into different curved shapes. Marketing suggested making the basic mould out of plastic with a rubber cover, which would give a spongy feel and be a cheap way to change the look of the device. Industrial Designer, User Interface and Project Manager quickly jumped on board with this idea.

The team decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover, rubberised buttons on the bottom side, and rubber as a padding or for the grip. They also decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic for the inside and rubber for the outside.

The team decided to use a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs for the rubber cover, and rubber as a padding or for the grip. They would use a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. The rubber would be made of spongy material and could be made in different shapes. The team also discussed the battery and the material of the case. The group agreed on the rubber as the material for the inside and rubber for the outside.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion of the design of actual components regarding interface design.

The team planned to do touch screen and there are two options to choose from, a bare PCB circuit board which could be in different colours and making a connection by the touch of fingers, and anti RSI rubber buttons with a LCD type of screen. Industrial Designer doubted whether a LCD screen is wanted as it would only be in black and white but have not thought out how to distinguish where to press if the bare PCB circuit board is used.

Industrial Designer first showed the schematic of the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which was what was used in pretty much every remote control at the moment and it sent out standard signals based on the input and it was pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the time. Then, Industrial Designer showed the prototype of the circuit board and the buttons, which were made of plastic and rubber. The buttons would be in an array and they could be in a sort of array and arranged in a set thing and the group would have to arrange the buttons on the screen in a kind of set thing. The group also discussed the battery life and the material of the case and the shape of the rubber cover.

Industrial Designer first gave a presentation on the design of the actual components and the availability of the components they had in stock at the moment. After that, the group discussed the material of the plastic shell, a variety of designs, rubber cover and rubber as a padding or for the grip. Then, they discussed the battery and the shape of the case. The group finally reached a consensus on the kinetic as the energy source for the remote control.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the team think about Marketing's suggestion of a sort of stylus to press the touch screen on the device when discussing the design of actual components?

Industrial Designer thought it would be lost easily and Marketing responded that it would be easy and cheap to replace or a pencil or pen could be used instead. User Interface pointed out that a person who switches channels often or uses a particular function will find it irritating to use and might spoil the touchpad more easily compared to a button. Industrial Designer agreed with User Interface.

Marketing suggested that people could use their fingers to press the button, or they could pull out a small pointer thing when people want to. However, the team thought that it would be irritating to use a touch-pad very fast compared to a button like a pointer.

Marketing suggested that people could use their fingers to press the button, or they could have a small pointer thing when people want to. However, the team thought that it would get easily lost and would spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like a pointer.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the team think of Marketing's idea of putting mirrors on the device when discussing the design of actual components?

Project Manager believed that it would not appeal to men as they were unlikely to use it when watching television. Marketing responded by leaving this idea on the side, and Industrial Designer and Project Manager agreed. In the end, Marketing gave up on the idea.

Marketing suggested that when they open the flip-top shell it would be a little compact mirror and when the user pressed a button it would respond to the turn of the body and give an advertising display. However, the team was not sure about the mirror effect on the device because they were marketing to guys as much as they were to women, so they decided to leave that one on the side.

Marketing suggested that the device could respond to the turn of the body and when the user pressed a button it would go onto the phone display. However, the team thought that they were marketing to guys as much as they were to women. So they decided to leave that one on the side.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the design and availability of actual components.

The chip TA11835 and PCB board will be used in the device. The use of kinetic charging was agreed by the team with a standby mode to save battery. The case of the device would be in plastic and would have a changeable rubber cover. LCD screens will be adopted. The idea of adding a stylus or a mirror to the device was rejected.

Industrial Designer first showed the schematic of the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which was used in pretty much every remote control at the moment. The chip sent out standard signals based on the user's input and it was pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the time. Then, the group discussed the availability of some of the materials and found that some of them were not available. Also, there was no rechargeable option available, so they decided to use the standard double A and triple A batteries, which they thought were a bit bulky and bulky at the same time, and they thought that the dynamo charging would be a bit silly because it was not very resistant to dropping.

Industrial Designer presented the design of the actual components and the availability of the components they had in stock at the moment. The main idea of the whole thing was just so you could press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and they discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find. The inside components was pretty standardised across the board. The chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which was what's used in pretty much every remote control was used because it sends out standard signals based on your input and it's pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the present. There was no rechargeable option available, so they were looking into battery options.

==================================================
==================================================
What are the designs of normal remotes and how can the new remote be different from the normal ones?

Mostly black and white colours, the normal ones are monotonous without consistency between models, and the buttons are very disorganized. The new remote will have a graphic user interface in the middle of the flip top and certain standard buttons with vibrant fruit colours. A newly developed speech recognition feature can be incorporated in the device and the idea was endorsed by customers. User Interface gave an example of using the feature - locating the remote. The idea was well-received by the team.

The new remote would have a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. It would be made of plastic and spongy and would be in a different colour. There would be a G-U-I-I interface in the middle of the flip-top and there would be some sort of touch screen on the buttons. The remote would be able to have a lot of standard buttons and it would be easy to find.

The new remote would be different from the normal ones because it would have a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. It would also have a G-U-I interface in the middle of the flip-top, which would be the most consistent thing in all remote controls. Also, it would be able to change the size of the nine buttons in order to be easy to use.

==================================================
==================================================
How can the cost be cut down if the speech recognition feature is adopted?

Industrial Designer said that it would be cheaper to re-manufacture if these parts were already in stock. Project Manager pointed out that the other materials used were relatively cheap and simple. Though the LCD would be expensive, it would be cheaper with black and white than full colour so User Interface suggested that they could start off with black and white and upgrade later.

The group decided to check into the financial feasibility of incorporating the feature of finding the remote control by voice recognition. It would be a cool feature to have and it would be technologically innovative also. The group also decided to incorporate the company logo in the design. They would use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover and the case would be made of rubber.

Industrial Designer proposed that the team could incorporate the feature of finding the remote by using a whistle. Project Manager agreed and added that it would be a cool feature to have and a selling point.

==================================================
==================================================
Summarize the discussion about remote control functions.

Industrial Designer proposed that a modern remote control should control a diverse subset of equipment. User Interface agreed and revealed that the function of the remote control is to change the state of the TV, which could be realized by pressing the button.

User Interface suggested that the remote control should be a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store. Industrial Designer suggested that it should be able to change the state of the TV by pressing the button. User Interface also suggested that infrared and Bluetooth could be used to communicate with each other. Project Manager suggested that they should think about the way how these things should communicate with other devices.

Industrial Designer first gave some initial ideas about remote control functions, such as interoperability between different devices. User Interface suggested that the remote control should work on different TVs or even different devices, so one remote control for all your equipment. Then Industrial Designer suggested that infrared should be restricted to infrared because infrared was not really hot technical stuff anymore, so infrared should not be used all the time.

==================================================
==================================================
What did User Interface think about remote control functions?

User Interface agreed with Industrial Designer and supposed that the remote control could be interoperable. That is to say, it could be a universal remote control that fits every device. He also revealed that the function of the remote control was to change the state of the TV and this could be realized by pressing the button.

User Interface thought that the technical function of the remote control was to change the state of the TV by pressing the button, which was just the basic technical function. There should be no other controls, such as a touch-screen or infrared, because they were too vulnerable to be used by a user to switch between channels or change between tracks on a CD player or DVD player.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Industrial Designer think about remote control functions?

Industrial Designer believed that a modern remote control should control a diverse subset of equipment. That means, one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment.

Industrial Designer thought that a modern remote control should control a diverse subset of equipment, for instance, D-V-D players, cell phones, video and audio equipment, so one remote control for all kinds of devices should be possible. In addition, he thought that infrared was not hot technical stuff anymore, so they should think about the things like Bluetooth.

==================================================
==================================================
What did the group discuss about the connection of remote control and TV?

Industrial Designer pointed out that infrared connection is old-fashioned so they should choose a novel one, such as Bluetooth. Project Manager added that the device should be rechargeable and not consume too much power.

Industrial Designer thought infrared was not really hot technical stuff anymore, so infrared should be restricted to the range. User Interface suggested that they could equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote. Project Manager agreed.

==================================================
==================================================
What did Industrial Designer suggest when discussing the connection of remote control and TV?

Industrial Designer proposed to change the way how the remote control and the TV communicate with each other as the infrared connection was not hot technical and suggested using Bluetooth.

Industrial Designer suggested that infrared was not hot technical stuff anymore, so they should think about the things like Bluetooth. Also, infrared should not be used all the time, so infrared should be restricted to that. User Interface suggested that they could equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote.

Industrial Designer suggested that one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment, for instance, cell phones, video and audio equipment. There should be some interoperabi interoperability between them. In addition, infrared was not really hot technical stuff anymore, so infrared should be restricted to that.

==================================================
==================================================
Why did User Interface disagree to use Bluetooth in the discussion of connection of remote control and TV?

Project Manager believed that remote control should not consume too much power. Therefore, as the cellphone would consume power very quickly when the Bluetooth was on, User Interface was concerned that it might be a problem.

User Interface thought that Bluetooth was old-fashioned and expensive. All the TVs were equipped with infrared, so it would not be cost-effective to use Bluetooth all the time. Also, it would be inconvenient to change the batteries every other week, so infrared should not consume too much power.
