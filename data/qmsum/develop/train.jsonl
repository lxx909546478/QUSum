{"source": ["Project Manager: Yep . Soon as I get this . Okay . This is our last meeting . Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation .  Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that .  Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over .", "User Interface: The prototype discussion .", "Project Manager: The prototype yeah . Do you need a  this ?", "User Interface: No .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Industrial Designer: Can try to plug that in there", "User Interface: There is our remo  the banana .", "Industrial Designer: but", "User Interface: Um  yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana .", "User Interface: Um but it would be held in such a fashion ,", "User Interface: where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through .", "Project Manager: Very nice .", "User Interface: And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam . That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . And um  that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "User Interface: Is there anything you want to add ?", "Industrial Designer: That's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might uh add some more underneath here . Maybe give it , give it a form .

Might as well think about", "User Interface: T the actual thing might be smaller .", "Industrial Designer: Th think about the button as well . Like either put either one  one on either side or", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: What but what's that button ?", "Industrial Designer: not do it at all . It's a quick on-off button .", "User Interface: Just the on and off .", "Project Manager: Uh , 'kay .", "Industrial Designer: That's um", "Industrial Designer: yeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that .", "Project Manager: 'Kay .", "Industrial Designer: Right ? Um that's not um", "Industrial Designer: I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . You wanna play with that over there .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: There you go .", "User Interface: It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh ,", "Project Manager: Would you like to uh", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "User Interface: but", "Marketing: Pretty impressive .", "Project Manager: Well done .", "Marketing: Kind of a banana .", "User Interface: And whether or not it would fall into the cost  everything I suppose . With the scroll and the LCD .", "Project Manager: Well luckily we are going to find out . Or not luckily . Um do you have a marketing presentation for us .", "Marketing: I do . Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . Um . Okay . So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that .  . Okay . So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ?", "Industrial Designer: .", "Project Manager: I think it's definitely different than anything else out there .", "Marketing: Mm .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely .", "User Interface: I would  .", "Project Manager: It's bright .", "User Interface: It's bright . It's", "Project Manager: It still has your traditional black .", "User Interface: It's curved . It's not  there's no sharp", "User Interface: angles to it .", "Project Manager: Yep , not angular .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average .", "Industrial Designer: However the colour , we don't have a say in that .", "Marketing: Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit .", "User Interface: Some people might say it . Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Marketing: That's true . Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: 'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: But", "Project Manager: Yeah something more modern to go  a a modern colour to go with the modern form .", "Industrial Designer: Right . Right . It's different . You don't want your uh three feet huge LCD dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that .", "Marketing: Um okay so , do you think , since we  This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Does that sound good ?", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: What do you think ? Three ? Four ?", "Project Manager: I would say", "Marketing: Five ?", "Project Manager: four .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Four is fair . Okay .", "Project Manager: Very non-committal , four .", "Marketing: Okay , the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ?", "Industrial Designer: It's very intuitive , I think yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah . I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had .", "Industrial Designer: S give it a one .", "Marketing: One ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: 'kay . Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?", "User Interface: Uh yeah . 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls  most common , which are channel and volume .", "Marketing: I'd say that", "Project Manager: Mm-hmm .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "User Interface: And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further .", "Project Manager: S scrolling through and selecting a few .", "Industrial Designer: Right . So that's a one .", "Marketing: So one ?", "Project Manager: I think that's a one .", "Marketing: Yeah ?  Okay . Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints .", "Industrial Designer: Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it .", "User Interface: It's bright yellow .", "User Interface: Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned .", "Project Manager: So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could", "User Interface: Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily .", "Industrial Designer: Oops . Hmm .", "User Interface: And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . That's gonna be a difficult shape to", "Industrial Designer: Well what", "Project Manager: And it is quite bright and", "User Interface: Yeah .", "User Interface: Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ?", "Project Manager: Uh", "Industrial Designer: S", "Marketing: Okay .", "User Interface: I mean you know  loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways .", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "User Interface: You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Marketing: That's true .", "Project Manager: But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think .", "Marketing: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: Oh yeah . You probably", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Probably two . You know . If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Project Manager: I'd say two .", "Project Manager: With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Y you could add an extra feature actually . Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far .", "Project Manager: Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a", "Industrial Designer: Yes .", "User Interface: Yeah true . But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap .", "Marketing: Annoying alarm or something ?", "Industrial Designer: It's it's", "Marketing: Yeah .", "User Interface: So it can't be that", "Industrial Designer: Um the  it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff ,", "User Interface: expensive .", "Project Manager: Some sort of proximity", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your  stick it behind your TV and the other", "User Interface: stick it on the TV  .", "Project Manager: Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Industrial Designer: That'd be tough then .  Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: So . Are we adding one of these two features ?", "Industrial Designer: Let's add one of those features and say yes .", "Marketing: gonna say  okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: So we're  back to a one ?", "User Interface: Two .", "Marketing: Or a two ?", "Project Manager: Two .", "Industrial Designer: Two .", "Marketing: Two , 'kay .

Three ?", "User Interface: 'cause it's stolen .", "Project Manager: I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth .", "User Interface: No maybe not .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah not really .", "Marketing: But how many remotes do you see like this ?", "Project Manager: If we added the screaming factor  then we go up .", "Marketing: Not so many .", "Project Manager: Um I would say we're probably at four .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: Really ? Okay .  That's gonna hurt us .", "Marketing: Okay . Um spongy material ?", "Industrial Designer: Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of .", "Project Manager: We have some spongy , yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah as much as as needed , I think .", "Marketing: 'Kay .", "Industrial Designer: It's not a one though .", "Project Manager: No .", "Industrial Designer: One would be the whole thing", "Project Manager: Yeah . Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side  the bottom  the underneath on the back .", "Industrial Designer: to fold and stuff . Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: So that's a four at most .", "Project Manager: Probably a four at most . Possibly even a five .", "Marketing: And lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ?", "Industrial Designer: Y yes .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Marketing: I'd say we did .", "Project Manager: If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha .", "Industrial Designer: More", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the LCD and the way you operate it than the form and the colour ,", "User Interface: On the", "Project Manager: It's true .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: but it definitely is", "User Interface: Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely .", "Industrial Designer: .", "Marketing: 'Kay .

I can't do that without a calculator .", "User Interface: No I can't do long", "Marketing: It's been a while .", "User Interface: very impressive .", "Project Manager: And what what is the acceptable criteria ? Is there like a scale that we have to hit ?", "Marketing: Oh no . They just told me to", "Marketing: pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it  basically .", "Project Manager: Alright then .", "Marketing: So that's that .", "Project Manager: Okay . Well , let's see .", "Project Manager: Now we get to do the budget numbers . You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . But we do . Okay .", "User Interface: Yeah . Yeah so . You'd been going a long time dividing that .

Okay . Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on ,", "Project Manager: but so we've got the energy source . There's uh four , five , six categories .", "Industrial Designer: Battery .", "Project Manager: We have energy source , electronics , case .

Yeah .", "User Interface: if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the TV itself .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Project Manager: So we may not need the LCD display ?", "User Interface: Uh that is possible yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Right .

After that, User Interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function. The prototype was yellow like a banana with a simplest quick on-off button and could be used both-handed. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test according to criteria found of the market trend as well as the customers' complaints and the team gave one to seven points to the shape, colour, material, controls and functions of the product. Thirdly, the team found that the current product exceeded the budget, so the team decided to completely discard the single button and LCD. Lastly, the team gave positive feedback on the project and the process."}

It's a quick on-off button .", "User Interface: Just the on and off .", "Project Manager: Uh , 'kay .", "Industrial Designer: That's um", "Industrial Designer: yeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that .", "Project Manager: 'Kay .", "Industrial Designer: Right ? Um that's not um", "Industrial Designer: I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . You wanna play with that over there .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: There you go .", "User Interface: It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh ,", "Project Manager: Would you like to uh", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "User Interface: but", "Marketing: Pretty impressive .", "Project Manager: Well done .", "Marketing: Kind of a banana .", "User Interface: And whether or not it would fall into the cost  everything I suppose . With the scroll and the LCD .", "Project Manager: Well luckily we are going to find out . Or not luckily . Um do you have a marketing presentation for us .", "Marketing: I do . Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . Um . Okay . So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale .

Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company .", "Project Manager: Mm .", "Industrial Designer: So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .", "Project Manager: Yep .", "Marketing: That's true . Yeah .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: 'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: But", "Project Manager: Yeah something more modern to go  a a modern colour to go with the modern form .", "Industrial Designer: Right . Right . It's different .

Three ? Four ?", "Project Manager: I would say", "Marketing: Five ?", "Project Manager: four .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah .", "Marketing: Four is fair .

I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had .", "Industrial Designer: S give it a one .", "Marketing: One ,", "Project Manager: Yeah .", "Marketing: 'kay . Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?", "User Interface: Uh yeah .

So that's a one .", "Marketing: So one ?", "Project Manager: I think that's a one .", "Marketing: Yeah ?  Okay . Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ?

Hmm .", "User Interface: And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things .

You probably", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Project Manager: Probably two . You know . If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Mm .", "Project Manager: I'd say two .", "Project Manager: With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget .", "User Interface: Yeah .", "Industrial Designer: Y you could add an extra feature actually .

Are we adding one of these two features ?", "Industrial Designer: Let's add one of those features and say yes .", "Marketing: gonna say  okay .", "Project Manager: Okay .", "Marketing: So we're  back to a one ?", "User Interface: Two .", "Marketing: Or a two ?", "Project Manager: Two .", "Industrial Designer: Two .", "Marketing: Two , 'kay .

Three ?", "User Interface: 'cause it's stolen .", "Project Manager: I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth .", "User Interface: No maybe not .", "Industrial Designer: Yeah not really .", "Marketing: But how many remotes do you see like this ?", "Project Manager: If we added the screaming factor  then we go up .", "Marketing: Not so many .", "Project Manager: Um I would say we're probably at four .", "Industrial Designer: Right .", "Marketing: Really ? Okay .  That's gonna hurt us .", "Marketing: Okay .

After That, User Interface presented the product which looked like a banana and was bright yellow except for the blue button. The style was as simple as possible in order to fit the customers' need for simplicity. Also, the product could be curved and used both-handed with advanced chips hidden inside, which seemed quite creative and identical to iPod features. In the end, Industrial Designer commented that the remote control could be smaller in size."}
{"source": ["Project Manager: Yep . Soon as I get this . Okay . This is our last meeting . Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting .

Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line .

Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity .

Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that .  Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .

{"source": ["Project Manager: Yep . Soon as I get this . Okay . This is our last meeting . Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation .  Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that .  Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .

Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .

Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that .  Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .
