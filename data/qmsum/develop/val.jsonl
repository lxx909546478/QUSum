Uh , we  I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we  we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So  uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and  and uh sort of we have  anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the  the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a  a couple weeks before um uh about the uh  the stuff you were doing with  with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers .

Um , I think especially since you  you haven't been in  in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that  that uh  that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some  some  some um uh work about I  I  I d I  I don't want to try to say cuz I  I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some  some potential collaboration there about  about the  about the  working with these data .", "PhD C: Oh .

Well , I don't know if we  if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple  a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't  Actually I think that  that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you  you start with that .", "Postdoc B: OK . Shall I  shall I just start ? OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .", "Postdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of  you know , relating to his  to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this  this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how  um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the  the  the causal aspects of the uh floor and  and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it   These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far ,  and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and um , the question was raised \" Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? \" And  and Dan Ellis said , \" Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now  we really don't need to \" . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret \" ahead of the game \" ? You know .

So you have to sort of get the idea that um , \" ahead of the game \" is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far .

So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation . Um , there was a  have been some nice talks recently by  by Lucent on  on their b", "PhD F: Hmm .", "Professor E: the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me , uh you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks .  And um , you know , th", "PhD A: W what is the um  the artifact you try to  you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?", "PhD F: Ciao .", "Professor E: Uh so it 's  it  you have a  a direct uh  Uh , what 's the difference in  If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would um", "PhD F: I 'm signing off .", "Professor E: Yeah . that would subtract off  the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so  so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation  Yeah , so you  Given that um  Yeah , so you 're trying to  So you 'd  There 's a  a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the  there 's a  a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself  adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract  essentially to subtract off uh different uh  different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had  you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a  there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .", "PhD A: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those . Uh , just the raw data , you would  you might hear kind of an echo ? And  and then this  noise cancellation would get", "Professor E: Well , I 'm  I 'm  I 'm saying  That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening .  What 's really happening is  Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you um try to r you  To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I  but  not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the  the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the  the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I  I  I want to use this uh  this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this  this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh  gets subtracted off from the original speech . Then you try to  you try to minimize the energy in some sense . And so um  uh with some constraints .", "PhD A: Kind of a clean up thing , that", "Professor E: It 's a clean up thing . Right .", "PhD A: OK .", "Professor E: So , echo cancelling is  is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and  and  and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you  if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .", "PhD A: When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um  some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was uh  And then it would come on and it was very clear ,", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD A: you know .", "Professor E: Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So um , uh anyway that 's  that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try  somebody look  And  and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data  plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . Uh .  Um", "Postdoc B: Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ?", "Professor E: Brian 's  Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know  There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right  the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those  those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right  you know , right  right uh  delays are  is , uh  is  right delayed signal is  is  is  uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a  in a situation that 's very reverberant   with long reverberation times  and really long delays , it 's  it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a  a c a complete inversion , if you actually  I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the  the um   the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you  you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and  and uh goes to infinity . So it 's  so there 's  there 's  there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents  I mean there 's all sorts of  all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we  we  we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking  uh , just picking uh features , which were  uh will give you more  something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was  I was gonna bring up . Uh . Let 's see . I guess you  you actually already said this thing about the uh  about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to  So this was the human subjects folks who said this ,  or that  that  ?", "Postdoc B: The a apparently  I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course . Um but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It won't be that many people who do it  that often , but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .", "Professor E: OK . Um , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that  that we have . We have  we have an hour uh that  that is transcribed , we have  we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we  if this really uh  Well , do we have that much ?", "PhD C: Not really . It 's three to four per week .", "Professor E: Let 's see , we have", "PhD C: So that 's what  You know , that", "Professor E: uh eight weeks , uh is", "PhD C: So that 's not a lot of hours .", "Professor E: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's  Yeah , so like thirty  thirty hours ?", "PhD A: Three  Three hours .", "PhD C: Yeah . I mean , is there  I know this sounds  tough but we 've got the room set up . Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this  but we don't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,", "Professor E: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .", "PhD C: so", "Professor E: Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .", "PhD C: I mean , is there  Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them  or some kind of deci I mean , that are less well  I don't  uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong", "Grad G: We had some good ones earlier .", "PhD C: There 's laughter , um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or", "Grad G: I think it 's hard to record those .", "PhD C: To be allowed to record them ?", "Postdoc B: It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .", "PhD C: OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , people will get", "Postdoc B: But I  but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .", "PhD C: OK . Well , if there is , anyway .", "Professor E: Yeah , I was gonna mention that .", "Grad G: Oh , that 's a good idea . That 's  That would be a good match .", "Professor E: Yeah . So  Yeah . So I  I  uh , I  I 'd mentioned to Adam , and  that was another thing I was gonna talk  uh , mention to them before   that uh there 's uh  It  it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data ,  that  that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a , uh , uh  or  and  and so it doesn't really give us the  the  the uh characteristics we want . Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can . But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" hey you have this panel show ,  or this  you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? \" And uh they may be willing to record it uh with", "PhD C: With lapel mikes or something ?", "Professor E: Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it  it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .", "PhD C: Right .", "Professor E: It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they  they  they start recording , isn't  als also is not going to be this exact setup .", "PhD C: Right . No , I think that 'd be great , if we can get more data .", "Professor E: So ,  I  I  I  I was thinking of looking into that . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live ,  uh that we could invite them to have like some of their   record some of their shows here .", "Postdoc B: Wow !", "PhD C: Well  Or  The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean , they 're on the radio ,", "Grad G: Right , as we are .", "PhD C: right ? So .  Um , I think that 'd be fantastic", "Professor E: Right .", "PhD C: cuz those kinds of panels and  Those have interesting", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD C: Th - that 's an  a side of style  a style that we 're not collecting here , so it 'd be great .", "Professor E: And  and the  I mean , the other side to it was the  what  which is where we were coming from  I 'll  I 'll talk to you more about it later  is that  is that there 's  there 's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and  and permissions and all that . I mean , they already do what they do  do whatever they do . So it 's  uh , it 's  So it 's  so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um  and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could  @ @ in the  under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester . And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh", "PhD C: Right . Yeah I was mostly trying to think , \" OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with .

Uh , we  I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we  we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So  uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and  and uh sort of we have  anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the  the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a  a couple weeks before um uh about the uh  the stuff you were doing with  with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers .

Yeah .", "Professor E: Yes ? You mean that as an event also .", "PhD D: To", "Professor E: So at any rate you were  you 've  you 've done some work on that", "PhD D: right .", "Professor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you  you haven't been in  in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that  that uh  that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some  some  some um uh work about I  I  I d I  I don't want to try to say cuz I  I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some  some potential collaboration there about  about the  about the  working with these data .", "PhD C: Oh . Sure .", "Professor E: So . So , uh .", "Grad G: You wanna just go around ?", "Professor E: Uh .  Well , I don't know if we  if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple  a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't  Actually I think that  that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you  you start with that .", "Postdoc B: OK . Shall I  shall I just start ? OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .", "Postdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of  you know , relating to his  to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this  this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how  um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the  the  the causal aspects of the uh floor and  and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it   These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far ,  and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and um , the question was raised \" Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? \" And  and Dan Ellis said , \" Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now  we really don't need to \" . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret \" ahead of the game \" ? You know . So it 's the  it 's  i What you  what you int what you draw  you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording ,", "Grad G: Hmm , metaphorically .", "Postdoc B: that um , i that  i we have enough space , and he continues , like \" we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling \" . So you have to sort of get the idea that um , \" ahead of the game \" is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far .

And um , you know , th", "PhD A: W what is the um  the artifact you try to  you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?", "PhD F: Ciao .", "Professor E: Uh so it 's  it  you have a  a direct uh  Uh , what 's the difference in  If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would um", "PhD F: I 'm signing off .", "Professor E: Yeah . that would subtract off  the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so  so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation  Yeah , so you  Given that um  Yeah , so you 're trying to  So you 'd  There 's a  a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the  there 's a  a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself  adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract  essentially to subtract off uh different uh  different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had  you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a  there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .", "PhD A: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those . Uh , just the raw data , you would  you might hear kind of an echo ? And  and then this  noise cancellation would get", "Professor E: Well , I 'm  I 'm  I 'm saying  That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening .  What 's really happening is  Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you um try to r you  To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I  but  not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the  the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the  the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I  I  I want to use this uh  this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this  this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh  gets subtracted off from the original speech . Then you try to  you try to minimize the energy in some sense . And so um  uh with some constraints .", "PhD A: Kind of a clean up thing , that", "Professor E: It 's a clean up thing . Right .", "PhD A: OK .", "Professor E: So , echo cancelling is  is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and  and  and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you  if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .", "PhD A: When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um  some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was uh  And then it would come on and it was very clear ,", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD A: you know .", "Professor E: Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So um , uh anyway that 's  that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try  somebody look  And  and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data  plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . Uh .  Um", "Postdoc B: Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ?", "Professor E: Brian 's  Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know  There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right  the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those  those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right  you know , right  right uh  delays are  is , uh  is  right delayed signal is  is  is  uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a  in a situation that 's very reverberant   with long reverberation times  and really long delays , it 's  it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a  a c a complete inversion , if you actually  I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the  the um   the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you  you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and  and uh goes to infinity . So it 's  so there 's  there 's  there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents  I mean there 's all sorts of  all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we  we  we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking  uh , just picking uh features , which were  uh will give you more  something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was  I was gonna bring up . Uh . Let 's see . I guess you  you actually already said this thing about the uh  about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to  So this was the human subjects folks who said this ,  or that  that  ?", "Postdoc B: The a apparently  I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course . Um but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It won't be that many people who do it  that often , but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .", "Professor E: OK . Um , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that  that we have . We have  we have an hour uh that  that is transcribed , we have  we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we  if this really uh  Well , do we have that much ?", "PhD C: Not really . It 's three to four per week .", "Professor E: Let 's see , we have", "PhD C: So that 's what  You know , that", "Professor E: uh eight weeks , uh is", "PhD C: So that 's not a lot of hours .", "Professor E: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's  Yeah , so like thirty  thirty hours ?", "PhD A: Three  Three hours .", "PhD C: Yeah . I mean , is there  I know this sounds  tough but we 've got the room set up . Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this  but we don't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,", "Professor E: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .", "PhD C: so", "Professor E: Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .", "PhD C: I mean , is there  Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them  or some kind of deci I mean , that are less well  I don't  uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong", "Grad G: We had some good ones earlier .", "PhD C: There 's laughter , um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or", "Grad G: I think it 's hard to record those .", "PhD C: To be allowed to record them ?", "Postdoc B: It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .", "PhD C: OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , people will get", "Postdoc B: But I  but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .", "PhD C: OK . Well , if there is , anyway .", "Professor E: Yeah , I was gonna mention that .", "Grad G: Oh , that 's a good idea . That 's  That would be a good match .", "Professor E: Yeah . So  Yeah . So I  I  uh , I  I 'd mentioned to Adam , and  that was another thing I was gonna talk  uh , mention to them before   that uh there 's uh  It  it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data ,  that  that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a , uh , uh  or  and  and so it doesn't really give us the  the  the uh characteristics we want . Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can . But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" hey you have this panel show ,  or this  you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? \" And uh they may be willing to record it uh with", "PhD C: With lapel mikes or something ?", "Professor E: Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it  it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .", "PhD C: Right .", "Professor E: It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they  they  they start recording , isn't  als also is not going to be this exact setup .", "PhD C: Right . No , I think that 'd be great , if we can get more data .", "Professor E: So ,  I  I  I  I was thinking of looking into that . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live ,  uh that we could invite them to have like some of their   record some of their shows here .", "Postdoc B: Wow !", "PhD C: Well  Or  The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean , they 're on the radio ,", "Grad G: Right , as we are .", "PhD C: right ?

I mean , they already do what they do  do whatever they do . So it 's  uh , it 's  So it 's  so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um  and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could  @ @ in the  under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours .

Yeah I was mostly trying to think , \" OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with .

Uh , we  I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we  we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So  uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and  and uh sort of we have  anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the  the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a  a couple weeks before um uh about the uh  the stuff you were doing with  with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else", "PhD D: Yeah .", "Professor E: like some other noise .", "PhD D: Uh - huh . Yeah .", "Professor E: Yes ? You mean that as an event also .", "PhD D: To", "Professor E: So at any rate you were  you 've  you 've done some work on that", "PhD D: right .", "Professor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you  you haven't been in  in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that  that uh  that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some  some  some um uh work about I  I  I d I  I don't want to try to say cuz I  I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some  some potential collaboration there about  about the  about the  working with these data .", "PhD C: Oh . Sure .", "Professor E: So . So , uh .", "Grad G: You wanna just go around ?", "Professor E: Uh .  Well , I don't know if we  if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple  a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't  Actually I think that  that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you  you start with that .", "Postdoc B: OK . Shall I  shall I just start ? OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .", "Postdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of  you know , relating to his  to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this  this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how  um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the  the  the causal aspects of the uh floor and  and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it   These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far ,  and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and um , the question was raised \" Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? \" And  and Dan Ellis said , \" Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now  we really don't need to \" . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret \" ahead of the game \" ? You know . So it 's the  it 's  i What you  what you int what you draw  you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording ,", "Grad G: Hmm , metaphorically .", "Postdoc B: that um , i that  i we have enough space , and he continues , like \" we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling \" . So you have to sort of get the idea that um , \" ahead of the game \" is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far . But there are a lot of different things like that .", "Grad G: So , do you think his interest is in using this as  a data source , or  training material , or what ?", "Professor E: Well , I  I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours", "Grad G: Mm - hmm .", "Professor E: and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're  already have and see , is there anything to this at all ?", "Grad G: Mm - hmm .", "Professor E: Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it .

And um , you know , th", "PhD A: W what is the um  the artifact you try to  you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?", "PhD F: Ciao .", "Professor E: Uh so it 's  it  you have a  a direct uh  Uh , what 's the difference in  If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would um", "PhD F: I 'm signing off .", "Professor E: Yeah . that would subtract off  the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so  so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation  Yeah , so you  Given that um  Yeah , so you 're trying to  So you 'd  There 's a  a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the  there 's a  a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself  adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract  essentially to subtract off uh different uh  different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had  you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a  there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .", "PhD A: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those . Uh , just the raw data , you would  you might hear kind of an echo ? And  and then this  noise cancellation would get", "Professor E: Well , I 'm  I 'm  I 'm saying  That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening .  What 's really happening is  Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you um try to r you  To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I  but  not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the  the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the  the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I  I  I want to use this uh  this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this  this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh  gets subtracted off from the original speech . Then you try to  you try to minimize the energy in some sense . And so um  uh with some constraints .", "PhD A: Kind of a clean up thing , that", "Professor E: It 's a clean up thing . Right .", "PhD A: OK .", "Professor E: So , echo cancelling is  is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and  and  and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you  if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .", "PhD A: When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um  some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was uh  And then it would come on and it was very clear ,", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD A: you know .", "Professor E: Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So um , uh anyway that 's  that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try  somebody look  And  and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data  plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . Uh .  Um", "Postdoc B: Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ?", "Professor E: Brian 's  Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know  There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right  the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those  those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right  you know , right  right uh  delays are  is , uh  is  right delayed signal is  is  is  uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a  in a situation that 's very reverberant   with long reverberation times  and really long delays , it 's  it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a  a c a complete inversion , if you actually  I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the  the um   the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you  you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and  and uh goes to infinity . So it 's  so there 's  there 's  there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents  I mean there 's all sorts of  all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we  we  we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking  uh , just picking uh features , which were  uh will give you more  something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was  I was gonna bring up . Uh . Let 's see . I guess you  you actually already said this thing about the uh  about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to  So this was the human subjects folks who said this ,  or that  that  ?", "Postdoc B: The a apparently  I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course . Um but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It won't be that many people who do it  that often , but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .", "Professor E: OK . Um , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that  that we have . We have  we have an hour uh that  that is transcribed , we have  we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we  if this really uh  Well , do we have that much ?", "PhD C: Not really . It 's three to four per week .", "Professor E: Let 's see , we have", "PhD C: So that 's what  You know , that", "Professor E: uh eight weeks , uh is", "PhD C: So that 's not a lot of hours .", "Professor E: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's  Yeah , so like thirty  thirty hours ?", "PhD A: Three  Three hours .", "PhD C: Yeah . I mean , is there  I know this sounds  tough but we 've got the room set up . Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this  but we don't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,", "Professor E: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .", "PhD C: so", "Professor E: Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .", "PhD C: I mean , is there  Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them  or some kind of deci I mean , that are less well  I don't  uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong", "Grad G: We had some good ones earlier .", "PhD C: There 's laughter , um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or", "Grad G: I think it 's hard to record those .", "PhD C: To be allowed to record them ?", "Postdoc B: It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .", "PhD C: OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , people will get", "Postdoc B: But I  but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .", "PhD C: OK . Well , if there is , anyway .", "Professor E: Yeah , I was gonna mention that .", "Grad G: Oh , that 's a good idea . That 's  That would be a good match .", "Professor E: Yeah . So  Yeah . So I  I  uh , I  I 'd mentioned to Adam , and  that was another thing I was gonna talk  uh , mention to them before   that uh there 's uh  It  it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data ,  that  that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a , uh , uh  or  and  and so it doesn't really give us the  the  the uh characteristics we want . Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can . But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" hey you have this panel show ,  or this  you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? \" And uh they may be willing to record it uh with", "PhD C: With lapel mikes or something ?", "Professor E: Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it  it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .", "PhD C: Right .", "Professor E: It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they  they  they start recording , isn't  als also is not going to be this exact setup .", "PhD C: Right . No , I think that 'd be great , if we can get more data .", "Professor E: So ,  I  I  I  I was thinking of looking into that . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live ,  uh that we could invite them to have like some of their   record some of their shows here .", "Postdoc B: Wow !", "PhD C: Well  Or  The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean , they 're on the radio ,", "Grad G: Right , as we are .", "PhD C: right ?

I mean , they already do what they do  do whatever they do . So it 's  uh , it 's  So it 's  so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um  and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could  @ @ in the  under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours .

After I just printed out a zillion of them .", "Professor E: Yeah , well , that 's  Um , so I  I do have a  a an agenda suggestion . Uh , we  I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we  we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So  uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and  and uh sort of we have  anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the  the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a  a couple weeks before um uh about the uh  the stuff you were doing with  with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers .

Yeah .", "Professor E: Yes ? You mean that as an event also .", "PhD D: To", "Professor E: So at any rate you were  you 've  you 've done some work on that", "PhD D: right .", "Professor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you  you haven't been in  in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that  that uh  that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some  some  some um uh work about I  I  I d I  I don't want to try to say cuz I  I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some  some potential collaboration there about  about the  about the  working with these data .", "PhD C: Oh . Sure .", "Professor E: So . So , uh .", "Grad G: You wanna just go around ?", "Professor E: Uh .  Well , I don't know if we  if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple  a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't  Actually I think that  that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you  you start with that .", "Postdoc B: OK . Shall I  shall I just start ? OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .", "Postdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of  you know , relating to his  to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this  this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how  um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the  the  the causal aspects of the uh floor and  and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it   These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far ,  and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and um , the question was raised \" Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? \" And  and Dan Ellis said , \" Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now  we really don't need to \" . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret \" ahead of the game \" ? You know . So it 's the  it 's  i What you  what you int what you draw  you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording ,", "Grad G: Hmm , metaphorically .", "Postdoc B: that um , i that  i we have enough space , and he continues , like \" we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling \" . So you have to sort of get the idea that um , \" ahead of the game \" is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far .

And um , you know , th", "PhD A: W what is the um  the artifact you try to  you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?", "PhD F: Ciao .", "Professor E: Uh so it 's  it  you have a  a direct uh  Uh , what 's the difference in  If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would um", "PhD F: I 'm signing off .", "Professor E: Yeah . that would subtract off  the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so  so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation  Yeah , so you  Given that um  Yeah , so you 're trying to  So you 'd  There 's a  a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the  there 's a  a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself  adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract  essentially to subtract off uh different uh  different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had  you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a  there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .", "PhD A: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those . Uh , just the raw data , you would  you might hear kind of an echo ? And  and then this  noise cancellation would get", "Professor E: Well , I 'm  I 'm  I 'm saying  That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening .  What 's really happening is  Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you um try to r you  To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I  but  not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the  the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the  the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I  I  I want to use this uh  this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this  this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh  gets subtracted off from the original speech . Then you try to  you try to minimize the energy in some sense . And so um  uh with some constraints .", "PhD A: Kind of a clean up thing , that", "Professor E: It 's a clean up thing . Right .", "PhD A: OK .", "Professor E: So , echo cancelling is  is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and  and  and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you  if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .", "PhD A: When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um  some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was uh  And then it would come on and it was very clear ,", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD A: you know .", "Professor E: Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So um , uh anyway that 's  that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try  somebody look  And  and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data  plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . Uh .  Um", "Postdoc B: Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ?", "Professor E: Brian 's  Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know  There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right  the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those  those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right  you know , right  right uh  delays are  is , uh  is  right delayed signal is  is  is  uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a  in a situation that 's very reverberant   with long reverberation times  and really long delays , it 's  it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a  a c a complete inversion , if you actually  I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the  the um   the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you  you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and  and uh goes to infinity . So it 's  so there 's  there 's  there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents  I mean there 's all sorts of  all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we  we  we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking  uh , just picking uh features , which were  uh will give you more  something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was  I was gonna bring up . Uh . Let 's see . I guess you  you actually already said this thing about the uh  about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to  So this was the human subjects folks who said this ,  or that  that  ?", "Postdoc B: The a apparently  I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course . Um but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It won't be that many people who do it  that often , but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .", "Professor E: OK . Um , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that  that we have . We have  we have an hour uh that  that is transcribed , we have  we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we  if this really uh  Well , do we have that much ?", "PhD C: Not really . It 's three to four per week .", "Professor E: Let 's see , we have", "PhD C: So that 's what  You know , that", "Professor E: uh eight weeks , uh is", "PhD C: So that 's not a lot of hours .", "Professor E: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's  Yeah , so like thirty  thirty hours ?", "PhD A: Three  Three hours .", "PhD C: Yeah . I mean , is there  I know this sounds  tough but we 've got the room set up . Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this  but we don't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,", "Professor E: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .", "PhD C: so", "Professor E: Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .", "PhD C: I mean , is there  Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them  or some kind of deci I mean , that are less well  I don't  uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong", "Grad G: We had some good ones earlier .", "PhD C: There 's laughter , um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or", "Grad G: I think it 's hard to record those .", "PhD C: To be allowed to record them ?", "Postdoc B: It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .", "PhD C: OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , people will get", "Postdoc B: But I  but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .", "PhD C: OK . Well , if there is , anyway .", "Professor E: Yeah , I was gonna mention that .", "Grad G: Oh , that 's a good idea . That 's  That would be a good match .", "Professor E: Yeah . So  Yeah . So I  I  uh , I  I 'd mentioned to Adam , and  that was another thing I was gonna talk  uh , mention to them before   that uh there 's uh  It  it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data ,  that  that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a , uh , uh  or  and  and so it doesn't really give us the  the  the uh characteristics we want . Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can . But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" hey you have this panel show ,  or this  you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? \" And uh they may be willing to record it uh with", "PhD C: With lapel mikes or something ?", "Professor E: Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it  it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .", "PhD C: Right .", "Professor E: It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they  they  they start recording , isn't  als also is not going to be this exact setup .", "PhD C: Right . No , I think that 'd be great , if we can get more data .", "Professor E: So ,  I  I  I  I was thinking of looking into that . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live ,  uh that we could invite them to have like some of their   record some of their shows here .", "Postdoc B: Wow !", "PhD C: Well  Or  The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean , they 're on the radio ,", "Grad G: Right , as we are .", "PhD C: right ?

Um , I think that 'd be fantastic", "Professor E: Right .", "PhD C: cuz those kinds of panels and  Those have interesting", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD C: Th - that 's an  a side of style  a style that we 're not collecting here , so it 'd be great .", "Professor E: And  and the  I mean , the other side to it was the  what  which is where we were coming from  I 'll  I 'll talk to you more about it later  is that  is that there 's  there 's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and  and permissions and all that . I mean , they already do what they do  do whatever they do . So it 's  uh , it 's  So it 's  so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um  and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could  @ @ in the  under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours .

Yeah I was mostly trying to think , \" OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with .

Uh , we  I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we  we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So  uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and  and uh sort of we have  anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the  the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a  a couple weeks before um uh about the uh  the stuff you were doing with  with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think , you know , what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else", "PhD D: Yeah .", "Professor E: like some other noise .", "PhD D: Uh - huh . Yeah .", "Professor E: Yes ? You mean that as an event also .", "PhD D: To", "Professor E: So at any rate you were  you 've  you 've done some work on that", "PhD D: right .", "Professor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you  you haven't been in  in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that  that uh  that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some  some  some um uh work about I  I  I d I  I don't want to try to say cuz I  I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some  some potential collaboration there about  about the  about the  working with these data .", "PhD C: Oh . Sure .", "Professor E: So . So , uh .", "Grad G: You wanna just go around ?", "Professor E: Uh .  Well , I don't know if we  if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple  a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why don't  Actually I think that  that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you  you start with that .", "Postdoc B: OK . Shall I  shall I just start ? OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , just explain what it was .", "Postdoc B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of  you know , relating to his  to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this  this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how  um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i \" Joe slipped \" you know , \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that . And I don't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the  the  the causal aspects of the uh floor and  and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it   These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far ,  and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and um , the question was raised \" Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? \" And  and Dan Ellis said , \" Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now  we really don't need to \" . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret \" ahead of the game \" ? You know . So it 's the  it 's  i What you  what you int what you draw  you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording ,", "Grad G: Hmm , metaphorically .", "Postdoc B: that um , i that  i we have enough space , and he continues , like \" we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling \" . So you have to sort of get the idea that um , \" ahead of the game \" is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far . But there are a lot of different things like that .", "Grad G: So , do you think his interest is in using this as  a data source , or  training material , or what ?", "Professor E: Well , I  I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours", "Grad G: Mm - hmm .", "Professor E: and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're  already have and see , is there anything to this at all ?", "Grad G: Mm - hmm .", "Professor E: Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it .

And um , you know , th", "PhD A: W what is the um  the artifact you try to  you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?", "PhD F: Ciao .", "Professor E: Uh so it 's  it  you have a  a direct uh  Uh , what 's the difference in  If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would um", "PhD F: I 'm signing off .", "Professor E: Yeah . that would subtract off  the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so  so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation  Yeah , so you  Given that um  Yeah , so you 're trying to  So you 'd  There 's a  a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the  there 's a  a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself  adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract  essentially to subtract off uh different uh  different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had  you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a  there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .", "PhD A: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those . Uh , just the raw data , you would  you might hear kind of an echo ? And  and then this  noise cancellation would get", "Professor E: Well , I 'm  I 'm  I 'm saying  That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening .  What 's really happening is  Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you um try to r you  To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I  but  not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the  the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the  the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I  I  I want to use this uh  this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this  this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh  gets subtracted off from the original speech . Then you try to  you try to minimize the energy in some sense . And so um  uh with some constraints .", "PhD A: Kind of a clean up thing , that", "Professor E: It 's a clean up thing . Right .", "PhD A: OK .", "Professor E: So , echo cancelling is  is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and  and  and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you  if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .", "PhD A: When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um  some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was uh  And then it would come on and it was very clear ,", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD A: you know .", "Professor E: Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So um , uh anyway that 's  that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try  somebody look  And  and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data  plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . Uh .  Um", "Postdoc B: Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ?", "Professor E: Brian 's  Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know  There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right  the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those  those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right  you know , right  right uh  delays are  is , uh  is  right delayed signal is  is  is  uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a  in a situation that 's very reverberant   with long reverberation times  and really long delays , it 's  it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a  a c a complete inversion , if you actually  I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the  the um   the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you  you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and  and uh goes to infinity . So it 's  so there 's  there 's  there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents  I mean there 's all sorts of  all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we  we  we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking  uh , just picking uh features , which were  uh will give you more  something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was  I was gonna bring up . Uh . Let 's see . I guess you  you actually already said this thing about the uh  about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to  So this was the human subjects folks who said this ,  or that  that  ?", "Postdoc B: The a apparently  I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course . Um but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It won't be that many people who do it  that often , but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .", "Professor E: OK . Um , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that  that we have . We have  we have an hour uh that  that is transcribed , we have  we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we  if this really uh  Well , do we have that much ?", "PhD C: Not really . It 's three to four per week .", "Professor E: Let 's see , we have", "PhD C: So that 's what  You know , that", "Professor E: uh eight weeks , uh is", "PhD C: So that 's not a lot of hours .", "Professor E: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's  Yeah , so like thirty  thirty hours ?", "PhD A: Three  Three hours .", "PhD C: Yeah . I mean , is there  I know this sounds  tough but we 've got the room set up . Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this  but we don't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,", "Professor E: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .", "PhD C: so", "Professor E: Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .", "PhD C: I mean , is there  Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them  or some kind of deci I mean , that are less well  I don't  uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong", "Grad G: We had some good ones earlier .", "PhD C: There 's laughter , um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or", "Grad G: I think it 's hard to record those .", "PhD C: To be allowed to record them ?", "Postdoc B: It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .", "PhD C: OK .", "Professor E: Yeah , people will get", "Postdoc B: But I  but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .", "PhD C: OK . Well , if there is , anyway .", "Professor E: Yeah , I was gonna mention that .", "Grad G: Oh , that 's a good idea . That 's  That would be a good match .", "Professor E: Yeah . So  Yeah . So I  I  uh , I  I 'd mentioned to Adam , and  that was another thing I was gonna talk  uh , mention to them before   that uh there 's uh  It  it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data ,  that  that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a , uh , uh  or  and  and so it doesn't really give us the  the  the uh characteristics we want . Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can . But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" hey you have this panel show ,  or this  you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? \" And uh they may be willing to record it uh with", "PhD C: With lapel mikes or something ?", "Professor E: Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it  it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .", "PhD C: Right .", "Professor E: It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they  they  they start recording , isn't  als also is not going to be this exact setup .", "PhD C: Right . No , I think that 'd be great , if we can get more data .", "Professor E: So ,  I  I  I  I was thinking of looking into that . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live ,  uh that we could invite them to have like some of their   record some of their shows here .", "Postdoc B: Wow !", "PhD C: Well  Or  The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean , they 're on the radio ,", "Grad G: Right , as we are .", "PhD C: right ? So .  Um , I think that 'd be fantastic", "Professor E: Right .", "PhD C: cuz those kinds of panels and  Those have interesting", "Professor E: Yeah .", "PhD C: Th - that 's an  a side of style  a style that we 're not collecting here , so it 'd be great .", "Professor E: And  and the  I mean , the other side to it was the  what  which is where we were coming from  I 'll  I 'll talk to you more about it later  is that  is that there 's  there 's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and  and permissions and all that . I mean , they already do what they do  do whatever they do . So it 's  uh , it 's  So it 's  so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um  and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could  @ @ in the  under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester . And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh", "PhD C: Right . Yeah I was mostly trying to think , \" OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with .

Uh , three months from now  Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh  which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours .", "PhD C: And we just don't know about the transcription part of that ,", "Professor E: So that 's", "Postdoc B: Yeah , we need to  I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards ,", "PhD C: so .
