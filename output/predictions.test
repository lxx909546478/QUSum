This was the Children, Young People and Education Committee's eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. The meeting started with Barry Hughes, Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who was senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales. Barry Hughes introduced that the bill was about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that was proportionate to the offending. There was a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. The more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted. The criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand.
Barry Hughes thought that the law should reflect contemporary society and the law was evolutionary in nature. The criminal law provided a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. There was a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and there was a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. In that regard, it could be argued that children had fewer rights than adults. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, did provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault.
Barry Hughes thought the law should reflect contemporary society and the law was evolutionary in nature. The criminal law provided a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. There was a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provided for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. In that regard, it could be argued that children had fewer rights than adults. However, the fact that they might not have many prosecutions was not a reason not to say that they shouldn't signify that certain behaviour was or was not acceptable.
Barry Hughes explained that when the police approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police, they apply the code for Crown prosecutors, which has a two-stage test. The first stage is whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is when the evidential stage is satisfied. If there isn't enough evidence, they don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because they wouldn't put an offence before the courts if they didn't think there was a realistic possibility of conviction.
Barry Hughes gave two examples of the divergence between the law in England and Wales. Firstly, there was an offence of putting an electronic collar on a pet. Secondly, there were other offences in Wales that didn't exist in England, but they didn't crop up very often. In terms of how they would approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, Barry Hughes believed that they would need to update the guidance, and it would go back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. There would be a further series of awareness raising.
Barry Hughes gave two examples. One was that the removal of the defense would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would in England, because the defence would still apply there. The second example was that they already had within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the CPS recognises this. There would be a different level of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it was fairly evident that there was a defence available in England that was not available in Wales.
Barry Hughes thought that there would be a clear record of any cases that were referred to the CPS from the police and that would be maintained by the police. However, he did not see a need to update the guidance, and it would go back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. There would be no change whatsoever to the burden of proof, nor to the standard of proof.
Barry Hughes thought that there were a great many offences or reports of crime that did not reach the CPS because they were dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. There was a document called the director's guidance on charging, which was issued by the director of public prosecutions, which set out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. There would be cases where it was genuinely very difficult to assess what was the best approach, in which case they would have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case.
The National Police Chiefs' Council had been working with deputy chief constable Sara Glen. She was responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of disposals. There was quite a range and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved.
The way Barry Hughes saw it was that, within Wales, there could build an infrastructure that provided for a range of out-of-court disposals. The police and crime commissioners could use some of their commissioning powers to work something up. It would need to be developed.
Sian Gwenllian AM suggested that under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who couldn't use the reasonable punishment defense was convicted of assaulting their child, then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that would inevitably have an impact upon their life prospects. Barry Hughes answered that this was unlikely to happen, because they already had a well-developed approach to dealing with the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they wanted to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication.
Barry Hughes thought that the numbers were likely to be very small, and any assertion of looking to meet targets would be a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean. In the CPS, we don't have targets for securing convictions or not. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets.
According to Barry Hughes, there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and the Ministry of Justice had taken action to deal with that, and they had had a number of people who were now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, they may have a problem, but in turn, they would be looking to recruit more people into those positions.
This meeting was mainly about the design of the remote control. First, Industrial Designer and User Interface gave a presentation on the prototype of the product. Industrial Designer thought that the product was innovative and easy to use, but User Interface thought it was not as advanced as it should be. Then, Project Manager gave an evaluation on the process of the design. The team agreed that the process was good, but it was tempered by the choice of components and the price. After that, the group discussed the colouring of the case and the material of the buttons, and they decided to use plastic or rubber as the case material.
Industrial Designer thought it was fancy because it was spongy, easy to use and easy to learn. User Interface thought it had a good look and feel and was easy to program. Project Manager thought the product was innovative because it had the voice recognition function and the scroll wheel. However, it was not good enough for the high-tech market because it didn't offer voice recognition and it was hard for novice users to learn to use. Marketing thought it would be hard for advanced users to use because voice recognition was not for the elderly and advanced users would not use it.
Industrial Designer thought the remote control was easy to use for novice users because it was spongy and easy to program. User Interface thought the voice recognition function was hard to learn because novice users needed to understand what to change channels and change the volume, so it was not for the elderly. Marketing thought the most important function of zapping, channel switching, volume, and mute was easy, but advanced functions were probably a bit harder. Project Manager thought it was a two out of three.
Industrial Designer thought the remote control offered enough features and was easy to use. Project Manager thought it was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality. User Interface thought the product was fancy and spongy. Marketing thought it had a good look and feel, but the voice recognition function was hard to learn and was not for the elderly.
The group agreed that the selling price of the product would be 25 Euros, which was above the original price of 50 Euros. However, they could not exceed the production cost of 12.5 Euros because the solar cell was very expensive, so they decided to skip it. The group also agreed to not use the voice recognition function because it was not that important.
The group agreed that the process was good and that the product was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality. However, they were not aware of the prices of the costs. Therefore, they decided to skip the solar cell and not use the voice recognition feature.
Industrial Designer proposed that the selling price of the remote control should be 25 Euros, which was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality. However, it was tempered by the choice of components and the price. Therefore, Industrial Designer suggested that the team should consider changing the casing to reduce the cost.
This was the functional design meeting, in which the team discussed the working design of the remote control. First, Industrial Designer gave an overview of how the remote would work. It would have two basic functions, the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the TV, and also a location function where the user could press a button on the TV and it would send a signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell where the remote was. Then, User Interface gave a presentation about the technical functions design and how to make that the best function for the user. User Interface suggested that the remote should be simple instead of being a mass. Also, the team should make some decisions on the colour, shape, size and shape of the buttons to best fit the target group.
User Interface first gave a presentation about the technical functions design of the remote control, focusing on the basic functions such as turning on and off the TV, channel selection, teletext, volume, power, and location function. Then, Industrial Designer gave an overview of the working design and incorporated ideas from the last meeting. User Interface suggested that the remote should be made in a user-friendly and fashionable way, keeping buttons together that were used in the same colour, keeping the number of buttons to a minimum, and also making it fashionable. The group then discussed the location function and decided to have a buzzer on the TV to send out a signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate to tell the user where the remote was.
Industrial Designer thought that a beep was the most reasonable to implement because it would send out a signal and the remote would receive the signal and it would beep when it was in line of sight, so unless the remote was actually in front of the TV, it would not work. User Interface thought that the buzzer would be easy to implement. Project Manager thought that it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you had to find the remote first to click the button and then it would start ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever. Marketing thought that if the TV was on it's making sound and the people on the TV were talking, then the TV's gonna switch itself to channel one, so if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light.
Marketing suggested that they could have a buzzer on the TV or on the wall or some place since the TV already had power. The buzzer would send out a signal and if somebody said one, then the TV would switch itself to channel one. However, this idea was challenged by Industrial Designer, who pointed out that speech recognition was really hard to programme.
User Interface thought that it would make sense to have a function switch button, so that users could switch to a function where they were either on TV, on DVR, or on VCR. However, Industrial Designer thought it would be hard to implement because there would be a lot of buttons on the remote, so they would need to design a separate base for that. Project Manager thought that they could just design the channel changers and the power button separately.
The meeting began with a kick off meeting with Sunil, who was here for the summer. The team discussed the progress of the Aurora submission and some of the work they had been doing on the Aurora model. The professor wanted to know what the team had been up to and what they were working on. They also wanted to learn more about how to deal with the noise in the model and how to improve the performance of the model. They discussed how the model could be improved by adding more spectral subtraction and other features to the model, as well as how to reduce the number of on-line normalization units.
The team thought that the lapel was a good choice because it was in the middle of the recording, but the team was concerned that it would not get rid of all the noise. The team also wanted to know if there was a way to reduce the amount of noise and noise that was causing the problem. The professor suggested that the team could look into spectral subtraction and on-line normalization.
PhD F informed the team that they had ordered twelve new machines to use as a compute farm. The SRI recognizer had all this P-make customs stuff built into it and they were using all the machines. PhD F wanted to make sure that they did not saturate the network with too many jobs at once.
The professor mentioned that Sunil was here for the summer for the first time and that the team was working on a kick off meeting, a kick-off meeting for the Aurora project, and plans for where they would go between now and then. The professor also mentioned that they were looking at ways to combine one form or another of noise removal with a neural network to improve the performance of the model. The team was also trying to figure out how to make the model more robust to different kinds of noise.
The team was playing around with spectral subtraction on the signal subspace. The team was trying to figure out whether it was better to do it on FFT bins or on the CMU system. The professor thought that it would be better if they did it on the FFT, but the team was not sure if that would work for large vocabulary tasks. They were also trying to find an optimum for the model.
The professor informed the team that there was one person in Grenada working in the cepstral domain who was working on a VTS and another in Lucent that he had met at ICASSP. The professor did not know who the person was.
The professor thought that the Wiener filter did not work very well if the SNR was very bad. He suggested that the team could combine spectral subtraction with signal subspace to improve SNR. The professor also suggested that they could combine the two approaches.
The meeting was mainly focused on the recording and transcription of the data. The team discussed how they were going to get people to edit bleeps out of the transcripts and how to ensure that the data were not accidentally bleeped out. They also discussed whether they should get another wireless setup, which was cheaper than the wired setup, and whether they could replace the wired mikes with wireless ones. They were also concerned about how they could ensure that their transcripts were not affected by bleeps.
The team was working on a new multi-channel audio recording system, which was running on a HMM base with six wireless mikes, possibility of six wireless receivers, and a wireless receiver. The team was also working on changing the headsets, which would require some hand-soldering or hand-sealing, and changing the connector on a wired mike.
The team agreed that they would incorporate additional conventions that Liz requested in terms of having a systematic handling of numbers and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about. For example, numbers would be separated in space and the letters would be placed in parentheses to indicate what type of comment they were. The team also agreed that there would be some differences in commas.
Transcribers have transcribed about thirty-two hours of data so far. The next step is to ensure that the data are clean first, and then channelized.
Transcribers would have to generate web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted to see if they could bleep out sections they didn't want to hear. They would also have to ensure that the data are clean first, and then channelized.
This was the second meeting of the meeting. The group discussed the ontology of the belief-net and how to design the model. The first part of the discussion was about how to deal with decision nodes. The second part was about the structure of the model and how the model would deal with different kinds of decisions. The team decided that the model should have an intermediate structure and the properties would be filled in from ontology items. The model would have properties that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter, view, or approach something, and the probabilities of each of these would depend on what kind of activity is done there.
The team thought that the user's budget may influence the outcome of decisions, but they needed to make sure that the decision about whether or not to enter the castle was based on whether the user wanted to go there or not. They also wanted to know if the user was going to view the castle when it was open or not, and whether it was a good time to enter. The professor suggested that they could have a "fit" node that was a measure of the match between the object and the entity.
The group members thought that the user's budget may influence the outcome of decisions, but they needed to figure out how much money they had left to spend and when they would need to enter the building. The professor suggested that they could have a fit node that was a measure of the match between the object's feature and the user, but that would have to be computed by someone else.
Grad E thought that the decision would be about whether to go there in the first place or not. The professor thought that it might not be true or false because they did not have an idea of when it would be the most appropriate time to enter the castle. Grad E suggested that they could have an intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go-there S node sort of fed into each other.
Grad E thought that the decision would be about whether the person wanted to go there or not. Grad E suggested that they could have two different things, Go-there and then the possibilities of how they go there. The latter would be binary and given that you're going there when it's open, you're more likely to enter. The former would be true or false.
The group discussed the basic design of what influences what done before they decide exactly how to compute it. The first step was to specify the conditional property of each node given its parents. The second was to find a principled way of saying what each of these is and how to get it to add up to one. The third was to get a weighted average of the probabilities of each of the decision nodes.
Grad D said that the way to deal with the problem was to have a mixture of experts. The way to do this was to view each of these as experts who were making a decision based on some factors and then combine their decisions and create a weighted combination. The H node looked at these four values of those guys and decided which of these was likely to be more reliable or most reliable.
This meeting was mainly about the functional design of the remote control. First, Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the technical function design for user interface for remote control, and User Interface presented on user interface design for the user interface concept. Then, Marketing presented on the market requirements of the product, and the group discussed the new product requirements, including the colour, the material, the shape, the slogan, the buttons, the colour and the slogan. After that, the team discussed the price and the cost of the new remote control and decided that the price would be 12.5 Euros and the price of the wireless remote control would be 8 Euros.
Firstly, the group agreed that the colour of the product should be yellow and the image of the society should be recognised in the product, such as the colour and slogan. Secondly, the remote control should only be used for television, so it would be easier for the user to design it. Thirdly, it should be simple and easy to use, so that it would not take too much time to learn how to use.
The user interface designer and the industrial designer recommended to design a fashion remote control which would be fashionable, powerful and easy to use. They also suggested to have a switch menu so that users could select which colour they preferred and make it look fancy.
The remote control would be able to connect to the TV with a box in the TV, so with the set box you could connect internet with your TV. However, Industrial Designer thought that it would not be part of the remote control design. Project Manager thought it would be better if people didn't have the technology to use the Internet because it was not so popular now.
Industrial Designer first gave an industrial design of the remote control. The remote control would be made of leather based and the system would be a bulb and an infrared bulb. The bulb would be somewhere inside and the bulbs would be in between the electrical device and the electronic device. The infrared would be cheaper and it would be less technology than the conventional one. It would be easier to manage and take less time for user to learn how to use it.
The project manager thought that a cable between the remote control and the TV would be a good idea, but he didn't think that a wireless remote control would be too much of a cost-prohibitive. He thought that the wireless problem was more David Jordan's problem.
The user interface designer recommended to have a switch menu, so that users could mix several functions in one button. It would be easier for the user to learn how to use the remote control and take less time for users to learn to use it.
The team agreed that the colour of the product should be yellow and the slogan should be recognized as the image of the society. The team also agreed that it should be attractive and not too many buttons should be on the remote control.
The user interface designer and the industrial designer agreed that the colour of the product should be yellow and the image of the society had to be recognised. However, they were not so sure about how to make the remote control look fancy, not funny.
The project manager thought that the colour of the product should be yellow and the image of the society had to be recognised so that customers would recognize the product when they saw it. Also, the remote control should be attractive and not too many buttons.
This meeting was the 20th meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. The meeting began with the introduction of the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, introducing legislation that would directly help Canadians living with disabilities, expand the scope of the wage subsidy and increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit. Next, the Minister introduced a series of measures to support people with disabilities that complement existing measures that were in place. Then, the meeting moved on to the discussion of the Canadian Armed Forces and the Canadian Red Cross. The Minister of Public Services and Procurement introduced that the government had an expedited process that could be completed in as little as five to seven days, depending on the accuracy of the test and the information supplied by the vendor. The minister also promised to continue to work with industry to build up domestic capacity. Finally, there were five really exciting accessible technology initiatives, including working on point-of-sale terminals for Canadians who were blind or visually impaired.
Hon. Steven Guilbeault (Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion) introduced that the government was fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the Auditor General, an independent officer of Parliament. However, the opposition party argued that the Prime Minister had not done enough to meet the needs of Canadians during the pandemic. The opposition party also alleged that the prime minister had misled the House in his response to a question about COVID-19.
The Prime Minister and Government were accused of being reckless in their response to a question from the opposition party. The Prime Minister had ordered Canadians to stay home and businesses to remain closed, at a time when Canadians had had to say goodbye to their relatives over Skype, and Canadians were not allowed to take their kids to the park, and restaurants were fined $800 for allowing customers to eat outside and not being socially distanced, in these times, the Prime Minister's son attended a mass gathering with thousands of people while not socially distancing.
The members discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various groups, including veterans living with disabilities, those who received CPP and those who receive disability payments, as well as those who were dependent on the CERB. Many of the members also expressed concern that the government had not taken any action on this issue.
Hon. Steven Guilbeault (Minister of Canadian Heritage) introduced that the government had already increased the budget of the Office of the Auditor General in the 2018-19 period. With this increase, the office was able to add the equivalent of 38 full-time staff to its team. The Auditor General had indicated that she would be able to do half as many audits, despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending.
According to Jagmeet Singh, a family that needed to buy groceries can't take those pretty words and buy groceries with them. The CERB would not be able to provide the necessary support for families in need. The Prime Minister had promised that if the government extended it, it would help all Canadians living with disabilities. However, the opposition parties had decided that rather than help 40%, or a significant portion, of people with disabilities, he wanted to help none of them. That was the wrong approach.
According to the GBA+ analysis, Canada was struggling to secure a reliable source of PPE. Some equipment procured from overseas had been substandard and couldn't be used. The government was giving about $115million to Quebec, but that was not even 4% of what was being requested. It was clear that Canada needed to rely on Canada for PPE, and the government was working hard to build up domestic capacity.
This meeting was mainly about the project of creating a new international remote control. Project Manager Ada Longmund introduced the project and the team members got acquainted with each other and each other's roles in the project. Then, Industrial Designer, User Interface Designer and Marketing Expert each gave a presentation about their specific roles. Industrial Designer was responsible for the design of the remote control and the industrial design was how the object would look like. User Interface designed the user interface and Industrial Designer designed the function. Marketing expert gave some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have. The selling price of the product would be 25 Euros and the selling price would be 12.5 Euros.
The team agreed that the remote control should be original, trendy and user-friendly. It should be not too expensive and easy to use. The selling price of the product would be 25 Euros.
Project Manager proposed that the product should be international because people would be interested in buying a new remote control with new functionalities that didn't exist in the existing remote controls now. Besides, Project Manager believed that the price of the product would be reasonable as it would be 25 Euros and the selling price would be not more than 12.5 Euros.
The selling price of the product would be 25 Euros and the product cost would be 12.5 Euros, which was reasonable. It would be sold in the entire world, and it would be not more than 12 Euros and 50 centimes.
Industrial Designer was responsible for the industrial design of the remote control, User Interface Designer for the user interface design, and Marketing Expert for the detailed design. Project Manager would be the manager of the project. User Interface Design would have to work on the design and also to work with the technical fun functions and think of the user requirement specifications. Marketing Expert would be in charge of the marketing trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have.
The industrial designer thought that the user interface designer would design how the user would know the relation between the user and the remote control so that the product would look like. The function designer would take care of the industrial way to transform it.
Industrial Designer thought that the user interface design was the function design. User Interface Designer thought the industrial design was how the user would know the relation between the user and the remote control and how the object would look like. Industrial Designer thought User Interface Design was the interface design.
The meeting began with a brief introduction to JavaBayes and a brief discussion about features of the model. The team discussed the prosody, the discourse, the syntax, and the verb choice of the models, as well as how to deal with different kinds of features in the model, such as whether or not the object was enterable or not. They also discussed how to distinguish between whether something has a door and is not public, and how to fit the probabilities of the latter into the former. The meeting ended with a discussion about how to make the model easier to understand.
Grad B explained that the initial idea was to have a flat structure with all the features pointing to the output node. Grad B thought that this was not satisfying because there was a complete separation between the observed features and the output, and it would be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that. The middle layer would have features along the lines of where the person wanted to go and what they had said previously and what the means that they should use.
The team decided to add a middle layer of features to the model, which would allow the model to infer whether a person is a tourist or a tourist. The middle layer would consist of features along the lines of where they want to go and what they've said previously and what the means that they should use. The features would include the location of the landmark, whether the person is in a hurry or not, and whether they're running an errand or not.
The intentionality of the model was discussed by the team. The first thing they got was that already the intention was already determined by parsing the data. The second thing was that the model would be able to distinguish between whether something had a door and was not public and whether it was enterable or not. The third thing they learned was that there would be a probability distribution over all verbs, which would allow them to infer whether the object was entering or not from the context.
The first idea was to add a middle layer, which would have features along the lines of where people want to go and what they should use. The middle layer would have a hidden layer that points to some of the real hidden layers, or the general hidden layer. The hidden layer would be a probability distribution over all verbs, and the probabilities would be probablistic over all verb types.
SmartKom was designed to deal with the problem of detecting whether a given object has a door and whether it is enterable or not. In order to do this, it was necessary to distinguish between whether something has a "door" and is not public. SmartKom would also help to detect whether the object is in a hurry or not, so that it can be more intelligible to the user.
Hiring was discussed, and the team decided that they would look for someone with experience in the Bayes-net, preferably with a background in computer science. They also wanted someone who was familiar with Java Bayes and would be willing to learn more about it.
This was the kick off meeting of the new remote control project. The team members got acquainted with each other by drawing their favourite animals on the whiteboard. The aim of the project was to produce a remote control that was original, trendy and user friendly. They discussed the functional design, conceptual design and detailed design of the remote control. They agreed that it should be easy to find, with a call button on the television to be able to find and a little light to make it easier to find. The remote control should be made of durable material and be water resistant, strong and furry.
Project Manager suggested that they should design a remote control that's water resistant, strong and furry. User Interface drew a dolphin because dolphins were smart and they jumped around in the water and they liked swimming and that was cool. Marketing drew a cat because cats slept all day and they were easy to draw. Industrial Designer drew a horse because it was pretty and they looked intelligent and they had binocular vision.
User Interface suggested that the remote control should have a call button on the back of it so that users could push a button on TV to be able to find their remote control. Project Manager thought that the call button could be a little light or even a vibrating thing because it was usually under the sofa.
The team agreed that the remote control should be hand-sized, so that it would not be too big to lose. It should not have too many buttons, and it should be mobile so it could run around and come back to find you.
Project Manager thought that if the telly screen was already a screen, then it would be possible to have a programming function, really easy to scroll up and down, on the remote control. However, if it was not on the button but it was telling you what to do, then the cost of the programming function would be too high.
Project Manager suggested having a clip on the remote control so that users could clip it to their remote control. However, Project Manager pointed out that the cost of a clip would be too expensive and they had to remember their budget of 12.5 Euros for the device, so they would have to see how much it would be.
The group agreed that the selling price goal was 25 Euros and the profit aim was 50 million Euros. They would hope to sell this product internationally, and they would aim to sell a total of 2 million units.
The team discussed how to improve the performance of their model on multilingual tasks. The team was concerned that their model was not performing as well as they expected it to. The professor suggested that they could look at multi-band, multi-language, and multilingual nets, which would reduce the number of outputs of the neural network. They also wanted to learn more about how to train the model on different linguistic features.
The team was concerned that the results were not as good as they expected them to be. The professor thought that the team should be careful because they had not done all their tests on multiple languages. The team thought that they should try testing on other languages.
PhD D explained that the multilingual model was trained on the broadest possible set of features without the task specific features, but with increased frame numbers. The model performed better on the task-specific subset of the data, but not as well on the multi-language subset.
The professor thought that it was not so much that the team got hurt because they didn't have so much representation of English, because in the other cases they had something that was much more diverse. He thought that there was not much difference between the data with English and those without it.
The team thought that they could reduce the number of outputs of the neural network by adding more features to the model. They had come up with three types of broad phonetic classes. The team was concerned that the model would not perform as well on multilingual tasks. The professor thought that the team should be careful not to reduce too much information.
The team thought that IBM was a good choice for the task. The IBM computers were easy to learn and easy to use, and the team was familiar with IBM's software. The team also thought that they could use the IBM computers to train their neural networks on different languages.
The LDA introduced delays but they were claiming that it was within the boundaries of the model. The team thought that this was a good idea because it would give a better word error result and therefore would help within an evaluation.
This was the third meeting of the team. Industrial Designer, User Interface, and User Interface gave presentations on the progress of the remote control design. Project Manager gave a summary of all the decisions they had made so far, including the design of the casing, the energy source, the material, the colour, the shape, and the material of the case. Then, Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the market situation and the market trend. The team agreed that innovation was more important than ease of use for the target group, and fancy look and feel was even more important. The group also decided to use a scroll-wheel for the voice recognition function and to use the regular chip instead of the advanced one.
The group decided to use the regular chip and the solar chip for the energy source. They also decided to skip the scroll-wheels and the fancy colours and to use rubber as the material for the case. The group also agreed to use a single-curved case with a scroll-wheel and to make the buttons spongy. The team also decided that the company colours should be black and yellow and the corporate identity should be in the corporate colours.
Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be curved in two dimensions, with push-buttons and scroll-wheels. User Interface suggested that it should be made of rubber and the material should be spongy. Industrial Designer also suggested that they could use a scroll-wheel with a button on it. However, Project Manager pointed out that it would be too dull to use scroll wheels and the group agreed to skip it.
The team decided to use rubber with colours and spongy material because the younger target group liked bright colours, colourful shapes and fancy look and feel. The team also decided to skip the titanium stuff because the market was different and the younger group liked more colourful objects.
When discussing the remote control style, Industrial Designer pointed out that double-curved design would be dull to customers because it would be hard to use the rubber buttons and scroll-wheels because it was all curved. Project Manager thought that the curved design was too dull for customers to like. Therefore, the team decided to stick with the simple straight-forward design.
User Interface suggested that the group could make four push-buttons in a round shape and scroll-wheels in a form of a round. The group also discussed whether to use a scroll-wheel with a button on it or not. Industrial Designer thought that it would be better to use the wheel, but User Interface thought that there was no possibility for them to use it because it was too dull.
Industrial Designer thought scroll-wheels were not really a scroll-wheel because they could not work with double-curved cases, but on their side, the volume button was on the side. Project Manager thought they could use push-buttons to control the volume. User Interface thought it was too dull to use scroll wheels with a button on it. Industrial Designer thought there was no possibility for them to use the scroll wheel because it was not a fancy new technology.
The team decided not to use LCD displays because they did not think they needed it on the remote control because it was not flashy and new. Also, they were not sure about the financial part of the cost. LCD was not standard and the market would not like new flashy technology.
The Children, Young People and Education Committee had a further evidence session, number four, on the inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. The committee members gave evidence on the different aspects of the qualification, such as whether it was a rigorous qualification that stood up to a Russell university's expectations, and whether the qualification should be focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. They also discussed whether it should be a one-size-fits-all approach.
According to Dafydd Evans, most employers in Wales were small or microbusinesses. Not many of them had indicated that the Welsh baccalaureate was providing the skills that they needed. They were having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications. Therefore, they did not really sell this to employers to actually engage with them. And the only way they would get employer buy-in was if they felt ownership of what's being done.
Ed Evans (director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association) thought that most employers in Wales were small or microbusinesses, and most of them had not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. They were a little bit too focused on the academic side of things. The Welsh baccalaureate had turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which was putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, and the student getting all the information together at the end of the year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require was very questionable.
Dafydd Evans thought that they needed to review the qualification, and the voice of employers should be a key part of that review, so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills had more of a role within that qualification. The Welsh baccalaureate should be seen as an important part of creating a rounded individual ready for employment. And the only way they would get employer buy-in was if they felt ownership of what's being done.
Dafydd Evans thought that one of the problems was that they had a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they needed to resit their GCSEs—in maths, English and Welsh. So, at level 1 and 2, there were fewer and fewer doing 1/2 in the baccalaureate because they were resitting their GCSAs, and there was much more use of the Welsh baccalaurate at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3. However, if getting the qualification was how they got the money, then they might be tempted to go for it.
Kay Martin (principal of Cardiff and Vale College) thought that the Welsh baccalaureate helped to prepare learners for employment, but it was not for everyone, because some people had to do the other things. The Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification, it's a combination. It helps prepare some people—the A-level students for university, but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable? No, it doesn't.
Dafydd Evans thought that one of the problems was that they had a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they needed to resit their GCSEs—in maths, English and Welsh. The Welsh baccalaureate was a combination of qualifications; it was not just one qualification. Therefore, there was no room for everything in the curriculum and no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications.
According to Kay Martin, they don't think they believe that universities in the main understand the value of the Welsh baccalaureate, especially the experience they have with some of their learners to go to Russell Group universities. They do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade, but it's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels. It is mixed, and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they're going into in universities.
Nick Brazil (deputy principal) thought it was mixed, and it depended on the admissions tutors and the areas that they were going into in universities. About 20 per cent of our learners went to Russell Group universities, and there was no doubt that they did not value the Welsh baccalaureate. But if they did offer an option with the Welsh, they said it was on top of three A2-level grades. So, they did accept it. It was valued by them and they accepted it, but when people went further afield, they were always trying to push our learners beyond.
According to Dafydd Evans, there was no problem there. Because of the nature of the catchment area, there were a greater percentage of students staying in Welsh universities and, as Kay said, Welsh universities were much more willing to recognise the baccalaureate. However, the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities would make different decisions, and also make the decision dependent on whether it was a facilitating subject or an enabling subject, which the Russell Group report indicated about facilitating subjects, and Welsh bac at the moment was not a facilitating
Dafydd Evans thought that training was required regarding the Welsh baccalaureate, but where they are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. Therefore, if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualized, and for the vocational librarians to do that, and they've invested heavily in training those vocational teachers to understand how to deliver the bac. They need to spend less time in checking what they've done on assessment and more time in the doing, and the experiential learning that they need to do.
Dafydd Evans (chair of ColegauCymru) thought that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh baccalaureate would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. However, he thought that if it was going to be a success, it had to be contextualized, and for the vocational lecturers to do that, and they had invested heavily in training those vocational librarians to understand how to deliver Welsh bac and get positive outcomes. He also thought that there was a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world were not A-Levels.
Nick Brazil (deputy principal) thought that the number of the skills and the challenges that were done within the Welsh baccalaureate were done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well. Therefore, if it was going to be a success, it had to be contextualised, and for the vocational lecturers to do that, and they had invested heavily in training those vocational librarians to understand how to deliver the bac.
This was an evidence session to scrutinise the Welsh Government's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales. First, Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, Steve Davies, director of the education directorate, and Claire Bennett, deputy director for curriculum and assessment, gave a presentation on the progress of the draft curriculum and its impact on the curriculum. Then, the committee members asked Kirsty and Steve about the main messages they had received during the feedback period on the draft. They received what they would describe as positive feedback regarding the emphasis placed on ongoing assessment that was there to support children's learning and progression. There were also mixed views on the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions included in that area of learning. The committee members also asked about the impact of the curriculum on students' attitudes towards the curriculum and how the curriculum would be adapted to meet the needs of each individual member of the school community.
According to Kirsty, the original proposal that they began working on was to provide for the four purposes—so, the four main purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you'll all be familiar with. Then, below that, they were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency—which had already been made that statutory, so, for instance, above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports. Also, they would make a statutory provision for the 'what matters' statements within that, which would provide greater certainty and greater clarity about the expectations at a national level.
The two main new areas that they are now working on to include within the Bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody and to ensure the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system. They will make a statutory provision for the 'What matters' statement. They would also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out the approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas.
According to Kirsty, the 'what matters' were the articulation of the big ideas. They were always intended to represent, as a whole, the learning that every learner should get. They would be brought down again to the 'What matters' statements within that, providing greater certainty and greater clarity about the expectations at a national level.
According to Kirsty Williams, the government was big supporters of the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton. The government believed that the Welsh Government needed more research into Welsh education, not less. The Welsh Government would continue to support the work of WISERD and the work that they were doing.
The WISERD research suggested that the senior management teams would certainly buy into what the management teams were saying, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. The primary purpose for assessment was for that professional to be able to know how to move that child's educational journey on, and they would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents, whether they were using formative methods of assessment or summative methods.
The first thing to realise was that the curriculum was not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it was always useful to reflect on how other systems had undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that had arisen. The second thing to realize was that their curriculum was a copy-cat of other systems, but they had had people who had been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of their curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we had had in terms of developing coherence. The third thing was that they had embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of the curriculum assessment group. The fourth thing was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content.
The money was being made available to each and every school and empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we had just heard from Claire, there were some schools that had been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore were further along that development chain. There were other schools that maybe were only beginning now, now that it was published, to be really engaging with the curriculum. So, investing in the profession was absolutely crucial.
The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and, clearly, Kirsty Williams AM continued to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning. There would be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development, as well as anything else. The schools as learning organizations were an important part, again, so that money was being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the OECD.
According to Kirsty Williams, the innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as they do the final refinement, and their main role was working with schools on the final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues. The innovation schools were chosen because of their ability to do that. They were also chosen because they were able to meet with the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model. They had 16 schools that were invited to apply to morph into the next phase, which was innovation schools, and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within Welsh Government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do the role and to continue to work with us, going forward.
Children's rights, human rights, were key considerations throughout the design, and this was currently set out in overarching guidance and they continued to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. They had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and they had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms. The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning.
Kirsty Williams AM thought it was really important that whatever resources they had to support the Welsh dimension were really broad and not confined to specific areas. The continuum for language would have to be contextualized depending on the setting where a child was being taught. There would be progression points on that continuum that would be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language and they would be contextualised. They would also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out the approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas and some of the advice that they had had in terms of developing coherence.
The continuum for language would have to be contextualized depending on the setting where a child was being taught. There would be progression points on that continuum that would be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language, and they would be contextualised. They had to recognise that there would be a Welsh dimension right the way across the curriculum, and it was important that whatever resources they had to support the Welsh dimension were really broad and not confined to specific areas. They also had to contextualize that learning continuum according to the medium of tuition with the school, but recognising that it was a progression.
This meeting was mainly about the design of the remote control. First, Project Manager introduced the agenda of the meeting. Then, Industrial Designer, User Interface, Marketing, and Project Manager each gave a presentation about their respective presentations. After that, the group had a discussion about the functional design, the conceptual design, and the details of the user requirements. The group agreed that the design should be original, trendy, user-friendly, and not only for the technical person, but also for kids and elderly people. The remote control should be made of a universal shape, with a lot of buttons on it, and it should not be too big or too small. Also, it had to be made with a good quality and the infrared thing must be from very good quality.
The group agreed that the remote control should be original, trendy, user-friendly, and not only for technical persons. It should be big enough for the buttons, but not too big, and it should not be too small. The group also agreed that it should be made of a different form than a normal remote control, so that it could be more trendy and trendy. They also agreed to make it child-proof and to care for the strength of the remote controls.
The Project Manager thought that the remote control should not be too big because it had to have a lot of functions and the strength was not as good as a normal remote control. Also, it should be clear so that kids and elderly users could use it from everywhere in the room, and the infrared thing must be from very good quality.
The Marketing thought that the remote control should not be too big or too small, because it had to have a lot of functions and the strength was not as good as a normal remote control. Also, the Industrial Design thought that a touch screen would be too fragile and not reachable.
Industrial Design suggested that the remote control should be made of a square shape so that it would not be too big or too small, and that it could be made with a small touch screen on the top so that the buttons would be easy to reach. Also, the infrared thing must be from a good quality and the infrared would be from very good quality. Industrial Design also suggested that it should be clear so that kids and elderly people could use it.
The remote control would have basic things on the same place, like on off button on top and the TV channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume on top, so that the user could see the basic options on the remote control. It would be big enough for the buttons, but not too big. The remote control should be made of a square shape and not too small. It should not be too big or too small, because it had to have a lot of functions. It had to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
The User Interface suggested that the basic things on the remote control should be on the same place, like on the off button on top and the TV channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume and the basic options on top, so that the user can see. The on off button should be clear so that users can see it, and the volume on top can be clear as well. The User Interface also suggested to make something like mobile phones that you can fold open to see more options.
The meeting focused on the collection of data from the Meeting Recorder. The team was concerned that they were running out of space to store meeting data, and that they needed to consolidate meeting data onto one disk. The professor suggested that they could move the Aurora data onto the Broadcast News disk, which would give them more space, but the team was skeptical that this would be a good idea. They also discussed how they could get more data from a subset of the meeting participants, and how the data could be used for other kinds of research.
The team thought that it would be a good idea to collect more data from different types of meetings. They would like to have more regular meetings of different types, but they should not have fifty different kinds of meetings to satisfy all the needs. They should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries.
Grad B suggested that the only thing they should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English. Postdoc E thought that it would be OK if a few people didn't have particularly good English skills, but it would seem to be a good thing if more people were more proficient in academic English.
The team discussed the location of the recording equipment and the possibility of placing it in the phonology lab or in the linguistics department. The team thought that it would be a good idea to move the Aurora data onto the Broadcast News disk and consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out.
The professor thought that it would be difficult to put a lot of head phones in different people when recording only with a single device. The team would need to find someone on campus who was interested in helping with the recording, but they would need a motivated partner to do that.
Grad B informed the team that they were getting more space on the current disk. The SUN rack took more disk space than the Andatico one did, and the Aurora data was taking up more space. The team was looking into other vendors to consolidate meeting data onto one disk rather than spreading them out.
One way to get more space would be to purchase a new disk rack and four thirty-six gigabyte disks. The SUN rack takes more disks than the Andatico one did, so the cost would be fifty percent more.
This meeting was about the design of the new remote control. First of all, Industrial Designer gave a presentation about the market research results of the last meeting. The team agreed that the new product should be a universal remote control only for kids and elderly, with good usability and stand out by being unique with the design. Then, User Interface presented on the functional requirements of the remote control, and the team agreed to make it more like a mobile phone, with a different colour or different shape. After that, the team discussed the working design and decided to make the product simple and standard.
Marketing first presented the functional requirements of the product. The product should be a beautiful remote control with good usability and stand out by being unique with the design. It should be made of good zap buttons and make it more like a mobile phone so that it would stand out from other remote controls. The new product should reach a new market with customers younger than 40 and not younger people. The user interface should be simple and standardised so that the remote control would be easy to use. There should also be a home station for remote control to recharge the batteries or something like that.
Marketing pointed out that younger people were more interested in new features than older people because they were more critical. However, older people didn't want to spend a lot of money on new features because they wanted to keep the old things the old way. Therefore, Marketing thought it was not useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition because it just wasn't useful enough.
Marketing suggested that the remote control should be simple and stand out by just the looks of the design. User Interface thought that the design was most important because there were already so many controls out that supported lot of stuff. So User Interface suggested that they could integrate the buttons in the design very much and make it a special product.
Industrial Designer first gave a presentation on the working design of the remote control. The method he used was to search the web page provided by Marketing and found a lot of findings about the user requirements. Then, the group discussed the technical function design. User Interface suggested that they should keep it simple and stand out by the looks of the design. The group also discussed whether they should make the design more user-friendly by making it more like a mobile phone. Then they discussed whether there should be speech recognition or not. The team decided to skip speech recognition because it was not useful enough for old people.
This meeting was mainly about the prototype of the remote control. First, Industrial Designer and User Interface gave a presentation on the basic elements of the prototype, including the look-and-feel model, the colour, the material, the buttons, the backlight, the scrollwheel, backlight and the slide. After that, the group discussed the design of the buttons and the colour of the case. Then, the team evaluated the prototype based on the criteria from one to zero and gave an average score of one to seven. The team agreed that it was a good design, but it was not as fast as a usual remote control and the second layer was not easy to use.
Marketing made some criteria based on the marketing strategy, the new needs and the market. The team evaluated the criteria from one to seven, giving an average score of one or seven for each criterion. The average score was two. For example, the team gave a one for fancy look-and-feel, a two for innovation and a three for learnability. For the team to give a high score for creativity, the average score would be three.
Industrial Designer thought it was easy to use, but the scroll wheel was not as fast as a usual remote control, and the second layer was not easy to learn. User Interface thought scrollwheel was very handy, but it would be harder to learn the second part, like speech, because there were so few information that users could easily decide what buttons were for what function. Project Manager agreed that it was a good point.
Marketing recommended to test the criteria from one to zero from the research about the new needs and the market, and give an average for each one to give a number. Then, the team could give their own average for the model.
The team agreed to use the drawing board as the main function of the product, but they did not want to draw on the blackboard because it was too slow and it was hard to make the drawings in normal computer style. Also, they thought it would be better if they could edit it from where they were sitting instead of pointing out on it.
User Interface thought that they got the wrong information at the wrong time. They had so much information that they could have had a discussion really quicker, but they got it all wrong at the same time. Also, they didn't know how many buttons were required or what kind of buttons speech requires. So they had to include them in the design.
This meeting was about the evaluation of the product specification and prototype design of the remote control. First of all, the team evaluated the product based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of the company. The team agreed that the product should be fancy look and feel, technological innovation, easy to use, incorporate current fashion trends, and incorporate fruit and vegetable strong design colours. They also agreed to use a kinetic charger to reduce the cost of the battery, and the voice recognition system should minimise RSI and be easy to locate. Also, they agreed to add a beeper function to the product to make it more user-friendly.
The group agreed that the new remote control should incorporate current fashion trends and incorporate current fruit and vegetable strong design colours. The design should minimise RSI and be easy to locate and easy to find. The group also agreed that voice recognition should be added to the remote control so that it would be easier to locate.
Marketing thought that the incorporation of current fashion trends in the prototype was a good idea because the spongy texture to the exterior and fruit and vegetable design colours would make the remote control look and feel fancy and easy to use. Marketing also thought that it would be easy to locate and the design would minimise RSI.
Industrial Designer thought that the type of button that they were going to use in the bottom half of the remote control, the material, and the shape of the rubber case would minimise the risk of repetitive strain injury. Project Manager thought that there was not much that they could do on the basis of current technology and their current capabilities, so they could not do much more to minimise that. Marketing thought that it was high enough at the upper end of the scale for them to go ahead with that.
The cost of the remote control was 12.5 Euros, which was within the budget. However, the team was concerned about the overheads like overheads and the heating for the building, so they had to increase the price of the product. They decided to take the voice recognition out and only use standard batteries, which would bring the cost down to 12.3 Euros.
User Interface thought that the replacement of the kinetic batteries would not make a huge difference because customers never said anything about the battery and customers were used to buying batteries. The biggest one would be taking away the voice recognition function, but if they took away voice recognition, people would not be willing to pay more for better product.
The team agreed that the incorporation of voice recognition would make the product more distinctive and set the remote control apart from the crowd, which would make it easier to locate in a first instance. The team also agreed that it would be quite loud and easy to locate, so they could adjust the volume on that, just as they could with the standard batteries.
This was the Children, Young People and Education Committee's sixth evidence session for the inquiry on education otherwise than at school. The meeting was mainly about the increase in the number of children and young people being excluded from school, and the reasons behind it. First, the group discussed the main reasons for the increase, including the prevalence of ASD—autism spectrum disorder—and trying to get the learners the right provision, which was sometimes a challenge. Then, they talked about the challenges to ensure that EOTAS learners had access to a broad and balanced curriculum, and that there were learning opportunities that were appropriate for them. The group also discussed the impact of adverse childhood experiences on individuals and how they could help to drive distress and suicidal ideation.
The committee members were aware of the funding issues and the challenges of funding that faced schools in general. In Torfaen, they knew that schools that were looking at their funding were behind, and they had to make these hard choices. They had to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners, then, and that did place additional pressure on the schools. It was difficult to know how headteachers and governing bodies would react. They would react in a particular way.
David Hopkins thought that the ALN legislation would put pressures on not just local authorities and schools, but also on the post-16 sector, because they were talking now about a wider age range—doing up to 25 as well. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister had currently made some more money available, if they looked at experiences that had happened in England, in particular, because there were direct parallels there with legislation, they would know from those experiences that ALN funding had become increasingly under pressure, and there had been big issues around tribunals, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribuni.
David Hopkins thought the factors that really affected exclusions were the very narrow measure at the end of key stage 4 attainment, which had put pressure on some schools, certainly, and headteachers had felt that—sometimes excluded, or otherwise put into another school as a consequence, which was regrettable, but that's what's happened. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister had currently made some more money available, if there were direct parallels there with legislation, we know from those experiences that ALN funding had become increasingly under pressure, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribunals, because they were losing them time and time again.
According to Nick Williams, one of the things that had improved a lot was the networking within the PRU sector. The EOTAS group meets on a regular basis, and that's nationally. There's definitely a better sharing of practice. And they're talking about professional learning for any teacher or provider, or it's sometimes the more informal training they receive by making visits, joint visits, to provision and also using the expertise that they do have within the sector to work more closely with our schools, and vice versa, particularly around the curriculum.
According to Dr Ian Johnson, the more challenging learners were the ones who were coming to the end of their statutory education, the key stage 4. It was far, far more difficult when they were 15, 16 to get them back into mainstream. So, then they were looking more at how they transit, then, into further education and colleges and so on. There was also a problem with schools only being measured on academic outcomes rather than the journey travelled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of children who were particularly vulnerable.
According to Dr Ian Johnson, the biggest challenge was the capacity. It was far, far more difficult when they were 15, 16 to get them back into mainstream. So, they had recognised that, so that they had their staff working very closely with the schools. There was an integration through a part-time timetable back into school, and they continued to support them during that process. Also, there was a team-around-the-family approach, to ensure what was needed for that learner to go back into the school, what can the school provide. There were restorative justice-type approaches being used by schools in Cardiff that seemed extraordinarily inspiring.
The committee discussed the pros and cons of local authoritative frameworks. The pros were mainly about safeguarding, which was at the forefront of their thinking, and the cons were around safeguarding. Local authorities were struggling sometimes for additional provision, and they were struggling to manage those pressures in their own provision whilst they went out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision was adequate. They also needed to think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision would be trained and supported.
In Torfaen, secondary schools had set out their own TCP—Torfaen curriculum panel—which looked at alternative provision. The meetings were facilitated and they were currently undergoing a review of the alternate provisions each school was doing because, sometimes, it was not quite working now, and it was understanding why.
According to Dr Ian Johnson, the difficulty with home tuition was that as a local authority, they were restricted on how much access they could get into the home. They were restricted in that respect. There was a lack of awareness and knowledge of children who had additional learning needs, and they were not entirely sure of how good the support was at schools. Also, there was a problem with schools only being measured on academic outcomes rather than the journey travelled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of children.
According to Dr. Ian Johnson, the biggest challenge was the capacity. At the moment, a newly qualified teacher can't work in this type of provision, which is fine, but they need to perhaps get mainstream first. There really isn't the capacity for them to access professional training. So, they need a group of people in the future to fill those gaps. Also, they needed to ensure the right staff as well, because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise, and once that person had moved on, it was really difficult to start all over again.
The biggest challenge was the capacity to train professional staff for special education. Because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise, and therefore, it's quite niche, and once that person had moved on, it was really difficult to start all over again. There really wasn't the capacity for them to access professional training.
According to Nick Williams, there was a PRU provision in the north of Powys and one in the south, so they had got provision for those types of learners there. But even so, the distances that those learners were having to travel were huge. It was a big issue. They needed to look at it in the bigger picture of what's happening, and they needed to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible had been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision, if it was possible.
This meeting was mainly about the target group and the functions of the remote control. First of all, Project Manager introduced some new project requirements, including the target market, the target age group, the colour colours and the slogan of the product, and the target function. Then, Industrial Designer, User Interface, and Marketing each gave a presentation on the new requirements of the new project. The group decided to drop the voice recognition function and to focus on the easy-to-use remote control with not so many buttons and a great feeling in touching the buttons. Also, they decided to use a low-cost circuit board and to use energy-friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components.
User Interface suggested that the easy-to-use remote control should be easy to use with not so many buttons. Industrial Designer thought that it should be a combination of volume and programme selecting, but teletext buttons were not in the design so it should take out eight buttons or so. User Interface also suggested that there should be no more than ten buttons on the remote control. Project Manager thought that they should go for the easier one because it would make a nice design when there's not much buttons in it.
Industrial Designer thought that the ten digits would be a bit dull and the remote control could be combined with speech recognition to make it easy to change the channel. However, Project Manager thought that it would be costly and hard to implement. Industrial Designer also pointed out that younger people would probably watch more channels than the older people and younger people might not like voice recognition.
User Interface thought that the easy-to-use remote control with fewer buttons was better than the multi-function one because the user-friendliness and it could be trendy in user design. User Interface also suggested that the remote control should take out eight buttons or so to take out the basic functions.
Industrial Designer thought that the remote control should not support teletext because the board felt that teletext was out of date and internet was replacing teletext, so they should not even try to implement it in their product. Project Manager thought that it would be a good idea to think about these buttons and and a sound signal. User Interface thought that they should focus on the easy-to-use remote control with not so many buttons and a simple design. Industrial Designer thought they should use a low-cost circuit board and incorporate energy-friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components.
The team came up with two solutions to prevent customers from losing their remote controls in the discussion of technical issues of the project. The first was to use a base station next to the TV, which would be the best solution because it would be easy for customers to find the remote control. The second was to add a sound signal to the remote controls, which could be combined with the find-the-remote control function. The team agreed on this solution because they thought that the most important thing for people was that there would be a central point to which they could go and perform some kind of some-kind of function, such as turning on and off the lights.
Industrial Designer thought that they should infra use infrared because otherwise their device cannot communicate with almost every TV set. Project Manager thought that infrared was the right choice because it was easy to use and the cost-effectiveness of the device would be high. Industrial Designer also thought that the low-cost circuit board would be a good choice because most of the production cost were in this part of the equipment.
This meeting was mainly about the detailed design of the remote control. First of all, Industrial Designer and User Interface gave a presentation on the prototype of the new remote control, including the wheel that would be used to change channels or volume or whatever, the base of the controller, which would be interchangeable, and the base would be made of plastic and rubber. Then, Marketing gave an evaluation evaluation criteria on the product based on user requirements and the trends found in marketing reports and in the company strategy marketing. The team agreed that the product was satisfactory, it fit the budget, and it was trendy. After that, the group discussed the production cost of the product, which was determined to be 12.5 points.
Industrial Designer first gave a prototype presentation of the remote control, showing the wheel that was used to change channels or volume or whatever, the power button, which was a button, a power button if you held it down, and if you just tap on it, the menu would bring up the menu. The base would be made of plastic and rubber, and the buttons would be interchangeable, so that users could change the colour according to their living room or whatever they wanted. The remote control would be hand-holdable and not too big, so it would be okay for the user to use it. There would be a hatch door for the more advanced iPod-like button, but it would not be to scale because it would have the battery inside it.
Industrial Designer thought the wheel would probably be larger because some of these remote controls were not as easy to hold. Project Manager thought the base would be bigger because it would be easier to hold in the hand. User Interface suggested that the buttons could be made in different shapes, but this would re-design the whole project because it might annoy people if they got used to having the buttons in one shape. Industrial Designer also thought that having different colours would be cheaper than having different shapes because they would cost more to produce.
Industrial Designer thought it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute. User Interface thought the team worked very well together and they all had ideas about it. Project Manager thought they all worked well together because they didn't really have any set roles so much. Marketing thought they had a great team spirit and they knew what they were doing.
Industrial Designer thought the base would be larger because some of the remote controls were not as easy to hold. Project Manager thought the wheel would be bigger because it would be easier to hold in the hand. User Interface thought that the touch pad in different shapes would annoy people if they got used to having the buttons in one shape. Marketing thought that having different colours would be a good idea, but it would probably cost more to produce.
Industrial Designer thought the team worked very well together and everyone got to contribute to the process. Project Manager thought the leadership was okay and that the team had a democratic process and everyone had ideas about it. User Interface thought it was good that they didn't really have set roles so much and that they all blended quite well together.
Industrial Designer was not a big fan of PowerPoint because he didn't really like the PowerPoint presentation and User Interface didn't like the idea of making up stuff and wrote a lot of notes instead. Project Manager thought that PowerPoint was not very user-friendly. User Interface thought that the information that was available to him was not that useful. Marketing thought that all this technology was more useful than looking at someone's notes because it was just the idea that they had.
The meeting began with a brief introduction to the current state of the project and a brief discussion of the current status of the prototype of the Bayes-net. The team discussed how the prototype would interact with metonymic and metaphorical constructions and how it could interact with the general construal mechanism of the probabilistic relational model. Then, the team discussed the conceptualization of the model and its implications for the model, including its ability to deal with different kinds of interactions, such as the interaction between metonyms and metonyms, and how the model could be applied to other types of data. The meeting ended with a discussion about the model's construction and generation outputter.
The thesis is about the construction of a probabilistic relational model that has some general, domain-general rules how things are construed, and then a general mechanism for coercing them. The idea is to use ontology, situation, user, and discourse models to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilic relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what
EML is building up a huge biocomputation project in Leipzig, Germany, and the team is meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him on the idea. The team is working on the construction of a tablet-based parser and a generation outputter. EML is a different level of analysis, focusing on the double helix building, which is different from the standard model of the human-computer telephone conversation, but similar to the model in the MPI.
The team was going to start looking at people's brains in a more direct way, which would involve looking at their brains in more direct ways. They were planning to do this in the near future. The team was also going to look at the more recent stuff about the kicking, which was discussed in more detail.
This was the second meeting on conceptual design of the remote control. Industrial Designer, User Interface, Marketing, and Project Manager gave presentations on the three concepts of the product. The first one was a Google controller with fancy look and feel, the second was a fancy controller with sophisticated functions, and the third was an intelligent controller with speech recognition and gesture recognition technology. Then, the group discussed the material and the material of the controller. The group decided to use wood as the material for the base and to use a combination of wood and plastic for the buttons. After that, they discussed the function of voice recognition and gestures recognition, and finally, they decided to design a remote control that was easy to use, technologically innovative, and user-friendly.
The User Interface Designer presented three concepts in the user interface design. The first one was a Google controller, the second was a fancy controller, and the last one was an intelligent controller. The user interface should give the customers the impression that their controller was very attractive and they could easy recognize it among a lot of products. The second concept was a combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions. The third concept was intelligent.
The user interface designer proposed the concept of intelligent controller because most of the people want to use the remote control to zap and zap between channels, so most people would not be able to use gestures to switch between channels. It would be convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface rather than use buttons because some time it would be very convenient to speak something such as voice or gesture interface than to use buttons.
The project manager thought it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller. He thought that most of the people want to use the remote control to zap the TV and zap between channels instead of using speech recognition or gesture recognition because most people would be bored after a while. Also, he thought that voice recognition and gesture recognition were risky because people would get injuries because of the same gesture.
Industrial Designer first showed the design of what was inside and what were the different component of the remote control. Then, the group discussed the material and the material of the product. The group decided to use wood as the material for the base and to have a spongy touch for the buttons. After that, they discussed whether to use LCD buttons or lighted buttons because it was fashion and it was related to how beautiful it was in the dark and in the darkness it would be easier to use. The team also discussed whether they should use voice recognition and gesture recognition because they could attract all the ecological consumers.
The group decided to use both the classical battery and the solar energy alimentation because it would attract all the ecological consumers and it would be an added value to the remote control. Besides, it could attract more eco-friendly consumers.
Industrial Designer thought wood would not fit with the wooden design because it would be too resistant to the spongy point of view, but rubber would be a special high class high-tech high-end material. Project Manager agreed with Industrial Designer that rubber was a good choice because it was not too hard to use and it could be correlated to energy, solar energy and the environment.
User requirements were mainly about fancy look and feel, technologically innovative, easy to use, and easy to learn. They also wanted it to be easy-to-use. They wanted to have a spongy touch, and they wanted the remote control to be able to be used without any object.
The marketing recommended to take the fashion trend into account when designing the remote control. For one thing, fancy look and feel was the most important one, followed by technologically innovative and easy to use. For another, fruit and vegetables were the most popular fruits and vegetables in the market this year, so they should take this into account for the design of the product.
The group agreed that the remote control should be technologically innovative, easy to use and easy to find. The group also agreed that it should have a fancy look and feel and be spongy. However, there were still some disadvantages with the voice recognition and gesture recognition, so the group decided to focus on the intelligent controller instead.
This meeting was mainly about the conceptual design of the remote control. First, Industrial Designer gave a presentation about the new speech recognition feature, the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker unit, which was expected to give a standard answer after it recognise a question. Then, User Interface and Industrial Designer talked about the look and feel of the new remote control, which should be fancy and original, with a fancy look-and-feel instead of the current functional look. The group also discussed the material of the case and the colour of the front and back of the control, and the shape of the buttons. After that, the group discussed the energy source and the backlight, and they decided to use a normal battery instead of an advanced chip.
Marketing first gave a brief overview of the market trend. The most important aspect for the remote control market was fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel, so it was very important for them to create something new. The second most important feature was that a remote control should be technological innovative, so they should use some of the new technology to be innovative. The third one was the aspect of easy to use.
Marketing thought that a fancy look was the most important thing for remote control, so the feel of material was expected to be spongy and the shape of the remote control should be different. However, he thought it would be annoying for older people because they drop their remote control very often on the ground.
User Interface recommended that the team should go more to the iPod and M-P three players to create a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel of the remote control. Also, they should use LCD as well as speech recognition.
Marketing suggested that fancy look-and-feel was the most important aspect for remote control, instead of the current functional look and feel, so it was important for them to create something new. Also, fancy stands for an original look and interface. The second most important feature was that a remote control should be technological innovative, so they should use some of the new technology to be innovative. The third one was the aspect of easy to use.
Project Manager thought that the shape of the remote control should be round and not square, so that it would only look like the old remote controls and not like the iPod. Also, it should not be too big or too small, and it should be more rounded.
Industrial Designer thought that the chip could be simple, regular or advanced, but the advanced chip was more expensive than all the other chips. So they decided not to put it in because it would be too difficult to implement. Project Manager thought the regular chip would be cheaper than the advanced one.
This meeting was the sixth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting was taking place by videoconference. The members of the committee asked questions about the government's response to the COVD-19 crisis. The first question was to the minister of agriculture about the large employer emergency financing facility. The minister answered that the government was working hard to ensure that the facility was available for companies that were going to continue to support the Canadian economy, including those that had run out of the fishery EI. The next question was from the member of the opposition party, Mr. Chris d'Entremont, who asked the minister about the impact of the Canadian government's decision to ban the Iver Johnson single-shot rifle, which was a standard farm gun used by many farmers in my riding, in fact, passed down from generation to generation in some cases.
The committee members were concerned about the fraudulence, tax evasion, violence handling and their supervisory supervisory. The Minister of National Revenue introduced that they had to impose conditions on executive compensation, including a ban on tax evasion and tax avoidance through tax havens. They also wanted to make sure that they were aware of the situation the companies were in, and to tighten the screws on these companies.
Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie was delighted to hear the Prime Minister say that there was no tolerance for tax avoidance. However, he quickly became disillusioned because it was more about abusive tax evasion and avoidance. The five big Bay Street banks benefited from this, as did the big multinationals. There were no conditions that would allow the government to tighten the screws on profiteers.
Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) said that they worked very closely with the Canadian firearms program, with law enforcement and with their firearms verification to identify the makes, models and variants of nine rifles, all of which had in their earliest provenance a design for military use, for soldiers to use in combat. These were specifically used for hunting.
Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors) introduced a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for those eligible for GIS. This means there would be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time. Beyond this, the government announced $20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that would help seniorsfor example, to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected.
Ms. Jenny Kwan pointed out that the government had moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit. However, as the member pointed out, when one moves quickly and efficiently, there will be gaps, and that's why they've been working diligently to try to fill those gaps.

Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages) introduced that the government would provide $2.5 million for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, to help the tourism sector and small businesses. However, the opposition party members pointed out that this amount would not be enough to cover the cost of the COVID-19 pandemic, so the Minister promised to provide more funding.
Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages) introduced that the government had had the opportunity to speak to my colleague Mr.d'Entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country, and particularly in the Atlantic region. In light of the new funding for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, the government would be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism industry to find ways to get this hard-hit sector moving again.
Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages) introduced that the government had made changes to the CERB to make sure that people who run out of the fishers EI were eligible as well as seasonable workers. The government had also put in place measures to address processors' concerns so that harvesters continue to have a place to sell their product.
The Covid-19 was already deeply affected by COVID-19. A number of industries, businesses and festivals were having to deal with considerable losses of income. The government had started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $62.5 million for processors, as well as to make sure that the CERB was available for seasonal workers and people who had run out of their fishery EI, but more needs to be done.
Hon. Bernadette Jordan introduced that the government had started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $62.5 million for processors, as well as to make sure that the CERB was available for seasonal workers and people who had run out of their fishery EI, but more needs to be done. The fishery enterprises were uniquely structured, which was why they were looking at measures to address concerns they had.
The oil and gas industry was facing a lot of stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government had to make sure that it was taking all the necessary steps to ensure that the industry was able to continue to operate in a safe and healthy environment.
This meeting was mainly about the final prototype of the remote control. First, Industrial Designer and User Interface gave a presentation on the prototype. The prototype was made by clay and the shape of the buttons was shaped like a mushroom with yellow and red colour. Then, User Interface and Industrial Designer talked about the features of the prototype, including the colour, the shape, the material, the buttons, the microphone array, and the material of the case. After that, the group discussed the production cost of the product, which was 12.5 Euros. The team agreed to have a production cost not more than twelve and a half Euros and a price of 25 Euros.
Industrial Designer thought the shape of the remote control was unique and looked like a pineapple, so they decided to call it a pineapple. User Interface thought the colour was pretty and the shape was good, so the team decided to give it a fancy look and feel. However, the team was not so happy about the shape because it was too much red and there were too many buttons. They decided to reduce the number of buttons and make the shape less smooth so that it would be easier to use.
The user interface thought the basic colour was yellow and red because it was the company colour, and yellow was more attractive than red. Also, yellow was their company colour. Therefore, they could turn everything in either yellow or black.
The marketing thought that the shape of the product was too much red and the colour was not in the trend, so the user interface designer should make some changes to make it look more like a pineapple with cherry on top. Also, the marketing believed that the product would not last for ten years because it was not a long-life product.
Marketing first gave three key points to the design of the remote control. The first one was fancy look and feel. The second one was technological innovation. The third one was technologically technologically in innovative. The last one was easy to use.
The group thought the remote control was technologically innovative because it had a microphone array embedded in the core, which could capture voice from different directions. Also, the group thought it would be interesting for the marketing team to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be able to sell it.
The marketing and the industrial designer disagreed with the user interface designer when judging whether the controller was easy to use. They thought that it was hard to turn things to change channels because the remote control had only one button, so it would be hard to control the scale. Also, they thought that the microphone array embedded in the controller would make it difficult to use, so they would have to design a different way to use it.
Industrial Designer thought the remote control would be easy to use because it would have a fancy look and feel and a unique design. User Interface thought it would be easier to use than traditional controller because it had a circle channel selection and a button to select the channel. Project Manager thought the colour of the product would be bright yellow and the shape would be like a pineapple with a yellow centre and a yellow and red centre. The group agreed on the colour, shape, material, buttons, and the material of the case. They also agreed to use solar cells as the energy source.
The group decided to keep the solar cells because it would be interesting for the marketing team to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be able to sell it. Also, the group thought that the cost of solar cells was too expensive, so they would not need to redesign the product.
The industrial designer was not so happy about the fruit shape because it was not in the trend. The marketing thought that the product would not last for ten years because fruit and vegetables would last for only two years, so it would not be a long-life product. The industrial designer thought it would be better to follow the flow and make the product now and after if the people changed their mind, then change also the product.
This was the first meeting of the team, and the team got to know each other better to feel more comfortable with each other. The team discussed the functional design of the remote control, conceptual design, what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that. Then, the team went on to practice with the pens and drew their favourite animals on the whiteboard. After that, they discussed the profit aim for the first year, which was fifty million Euros.
Industrial Designer thought that the remote control should be made of lightweight plastic so that it would save space and reduce the number of unnecessary buttons. User Interface suggested that they could integrate everything into one remote control so that users could use all the ones at the same time. Project Manager thought that they should keep it down to a black and white LCD thing anyway, which would make it cheaper. Marketing thought that it should be user-friendly to everyone.
On a mobile phone, you can press a key and it gives you a menu display, which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do. On a remote control, people might find it easier to browse and navigate.
Industrial Designer thought that the older generation would have to keep the remote control down to a black and white LCD thing anyway, as long as they can read it and can work out what everything's doing.
Industrial Designer thought that there was no reason to make the remote control look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone, because it could still be lightweight plastic. Industrial Designer also thought that using plastic did not make it cheaper.
Industrial Designer thought that one point four Euro would make a good selling price, but Project Manager pointed out that half of the selling price was taken up by building the remote control, so the profit aim was fifty million Euros in the first year. User Interface suggested that they could lower the price to make the product look a cheapie-cheapie option. However, Project Manager thought that it would depend on whether they wanted to undercut the price.
Project Manager thought that it was not a case of worrying about different languages and things like that, making that a key point. The target group of the remote control should be user-friendly to everyone, so that it would be accessible and usable by all age groups. The profit aim was fifty million Euros in the first year.
This was the second meeting of the second phase of the project. First, Industrial Designer presented the working design of the remote control. Then, User Interface gave a presentation on the functional requirements from the marketing point of view. The group discussed the market research findings and the requirements of the product. The team decided that the product should be user-friendly by being easy to use rather than having a lot of complex buttons. They also decided to make the product unique so that people would want to buy it. They decided to have a flip-top model with flip-open design, reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming, and a design to appeal to a wide range of people.
Industrial Designer thought that most controls used some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use, wireless and you don't need to send very much information. Project Manager thought that the triple A batteries were small and easy to carry, but Industrial Designer was not sure whether they should look at something else so they could shrink down the size of the control. Industrial Designer suggested that they could use rechargeable batteries, which would be cheaper in the long run.
Industrial Designer thought that most remote controls used some form of infrared to send signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use, wireless and you don't need to send very much information. The triple A batteries were the smallest you could get and they would last quite a long time.
Marketing first presented the market research findings from the marketing point of view and found that seventy-five percent of users found most remote controls ugly. Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy, and a high proportion of the international target group were prepared to spend more for something that's a bit nicer looking. Marketing also found that most people only used about ten percent of the buttons on the remote control, so it had obvious design implications there. Marketing suggested that they could cut down on the number of functions and reduce the size of the control. They could also cut back on the cost if they didn't have so many functions.
Industrial Designer thought that it would be quite expensive to incorporate an alarm because it would probably cost quite a lot of money, so he thought that they could take a cheaper option which still did the same thing.
Industrial Designer thought that people in Japan wouldn't buy two different sized controllers because the controller was physically to big and they had smaller hands. So they couldn't get round the controller which was why they could have bigger buttons for some countries and smaller ones for others.
The market research found that seventy five percent of users found most remote controls ugly and seventy-five percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Eighty percent of the international target group preferred a fancy looking remote control, which meant that a high proportion of them were willing to pay more money for something that's a bit nicer looking. The market research also found that most people only used about ten percent of buttons, so it had obvious design implications there. The remote control should be user-friendly by being easy to use.
The meeting was mainly about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting transcripts. The team was working on the transcriptions for the upcoming DARPA meeting, which is expected to be in mid-July. There was a lot of discussion about how to improve the quality of the data and how to make the data more robust. They also discussed how they could improve the performance of their models by adding more information to the data, such as the size of the Gaussian system and optimizing the weights.
DARPA was going to have a meeting in the middle of July to discuss the transcriptions for distribution. The team was excited about the prospect of meeting with DARPA. They had already done some preliminary work on the transcripts and were looking forward to the meeting.
Transcribers are working on a subset of meeting data that is ready to be transcribed and will be available for distribution in July. The team is working on the finalization of the data, which is expected to take about two to three weeks.
Transcribers have continued to work past set one and have gotten five meetings done in that set, but they are in the process of being edited. The team is still doing some final-pass editing, trying to convert the data over to the master file as the being the channelized version.
The segmenter has been performing well, and the team is looking forward to moving to automatic segmentation. The team was concerned that they were cheating by having the hand-segmentations as the basis of the recognition, so they would like to move onto automatic segmentations.
The segmenter is performing well and is improving. The team has hired two more transcribers and is working on a subset of the data that is ready to go into production mode.
The segmenter has been performing well, and the team is looking forward to moving to automatic segmentation. The team was concerned that they were cheating by having the hand-segmentations as the basis of the recognition, so they would like to move onto automatic segmentations.
The team was working on the Mississippi State recognizer. The team was concerned that the model was not performing as well as they expected it to. The professor thought that the team should focus on improving the model, and the team discussed how they could do that. They discussed how to reduce the number of Gaussians fixed in the recognizer, and how to make the model more robust to noise.
The team was concerned that the model was not performing well. The professor suggested that the team should focus on improving the net. The team thought that they could improve the model by adding more features to the model. They also wanted to look at how the noise subtraction was subtracting off speech, which was causing the model to perform worse.
The professor thought that the team was doing well with the model, but that the model was not performing as well as expected. He thought the team should focus on improving the model. The professor thought it would be interesting to see what would happen if they just had the neural net without the side thing.
The team thought that the most noisy cases were the distant microphone for testing and close microphone for close mike training. The team also noticed that the TIMIT noises were sort of a range of noises and they were not so much the stationary driving kind of noises, but the ambient noise was pretty different.
The team thought that the VAD was doing well, but the latency was too large. The team was concerned that the model was not performing as well as they expected it to. The professor thought that they were getting better recognition, but not as good as they had hoped. The VAD had a sixty-two percent error rate reduction on the clean version of the utterances, which was better than the previous VAD.
The professor thought that the VAD latency was too large. The VAD was used for on-line normalization, and it was used before the delta computation. The delta was two hundred and twenty milliseconds, which was a lot of time. The professor thought the team should not worry too much about it.
PhD C explained that the latency of the VAD was two hundred and twenty milliseconds. The VAD is used for on-line normalization, and it's used before the delta computation. The delta computation was done afterwards. The neural network used nine frames for cleaning of the speech, which added forty milliseconds to the latency.
This meeting was mainly about conceptual design of the iPod-like remote control based on fruit vegetable design. First, Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the components design, including the buttons and the wheels, the LCD screen, the chip on print, and the case material. Then, User Interface presented on the look and feel of the remote control and the material of the case. After that, Marketing made a presentation about the fashion trend of fruit and vegetable theme and suggested that the product should be spongy. The group then discussed the material and shape of the product, and decided that the material should be plastic and the shape should be shaped like a squashy ball.
Marketing had been searching the current trends in electronics, both on the web and via fashion-watchers, and the findings were that the first thing to aim for was a fancy look and feel, followed by technologic technology and the innovations to do with that. The second thing was the easy to use factor. The third was the spongy feel. The last thing was to make the remote look like a fruit instead of a vegetable.
Industrial Designer said that they would be custom designing the case, probably a hard plastic or some other material case to protect the remote and the locator, and they would need to custom desi design a circuit board, because the circuit board had to take the button input and send it to the output so they would have to design that each time. They would also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote. The infrared L_E_D was actually going to be included in their circuit board that came with it.
Industrial Designer thought that people would need a screen with music because they were looking for a specific song, like a specific band or whatever. User Interface thought that it would be silly to have a screen if people hardly used it. Project Manager thought that the screen would be better if people could scroll to get channels instead of using the wheel. Marketing thought that a wheel would be more expensive according to the design people.
The team had an option of batteries, solar power, and a dynamo. The dynamo would be interesting because the moment you move it, it creates energy on its own. Solar power was not available with the rubber case, so the team decided to use a wind-up or a kinetic thing where you had to wind it yourself. The team also discussed whether to use chips on print or chip on chip. The chip on print was more expensive than the regular chip, so they decided to buy in bulk.
The Industrial Designer thought that solar power was not available with the rubber case and the dynamo was a kinetic thing where you had to wind it yourself. The dynamo would create energy on its own, so it would be a little weird for a living room anyways. He also thought that the chip on the chip was probably the most expensive part of the chip.
The cost of the Kryptonite was determined to be 25 cents per kilogram. The chip on print was probably the most expensive part of the chip, and the chip would be mass produced in bulk. The cost of solar power was not available with the rubber case and the dynamo was not suitable for a living room.
This was the conceptual design meeting for the remote control. First, the group discussed the market trends, the material, the materials, the user-interface and trend-watching. Then, they discussed the design of the components and the availability of components at the moment. They decided on a flip-top with a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. The group also discussed the battery and the material of the case and the shape of the rubber cover. After that, they talked about the function of the LCD screen, the buttons and the energy source of the battery. They also decided to incorporate the image of the company into the design.
The team decided to use a combination of plastic and rubber for the plastic shell, a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. They also decided to incorporate the image of the company into the design and incorporate the word "Fruit" into the name of the remote control. The team also agreed to have a G-U-I-I interface in the middle of the flip-top and to use rubber as a padding or for the grip.
The team decided on a combination of plastic and rubber shell, a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. They also decided to incorporate the image of the company into the design and incorporate the slogan of the remote control into it somehow. The team also agreed to use a kinetic battery for the battery and to incorporate voice recognition for the finding it.
Marketing suggested that the market trend was fancy look and feel, rather than the current functional look, feel and feel of remote controls, and people also wanted a remote control to be technologically innovative and easy to use. User Interface suggested that they could take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, red chilli and yellow chilli, and the company logo. Industrial Designer proposed that the remote control could have a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. The group also discussed the battery life and the material of the case.
Most current remotes use a chip called T_A double one eight three five which sends out standard signals based on your input and it's pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the moment. The chip can be printed on the circuit board and the buttons can be made of rubber or plastic. There will be two types of buttons, one for volume and one for channel changing and the other one for the lower distance. Also, there will be an LCD screen on the remote control and a number of different types of switches.
Industrial Designer suggested that the standard double A and triple A batteries were too bulky at the moment and the dynamo charging was not very resistant to dropping, so they should be put on the case and the batteries would be smaller. Also, the kinetic charging would not last as long as the regular batteries, so it would be better to use the regular ones.
The team decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover, rubberised buttons on the bottom side, and rubber as a padding or for the grip. They also decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic for the inside and rubber for the outside.
Industrial Designer first showed the schematic of the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which was what was used in pretty much every remote control at the moment and it sent out standard signals based on the input and it was pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the time. Then, Industrial Designer showed the prototype of the circuit board and the buttons, which were made of plastic and rubber. The buttons would be in an array and they could be in a sort of array and arranged in a set thing and the group would have to arrange the buttons on the screen in a kind of set thing. The group also discussed the battery life and the material of the case and the shape of the rubber cover.
Marketing suggested that people could use their fingers to press the button, or they could pull out a small pointer thing when people want to. However, the team thought that it would be irritating to use a touch-pad very fast compared to a button like a pointer.
Marketing suggested that when they open the flip-top shell it would be a little compact mirror and when the user pressed a button it would respond to the turn of the body and give an advertising display. However, the team was not sure about the mirror effect on the device because they were marketing to guys as much as they were to women, so they decided to leave that one on the side.
Industrial Designer first showed the schematic of the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which was used in pretty much every remote control at the moment. The chip sent out standard signals based on the user's input and it was pretty much used for all all TV remotes at the time. Then, the group discussed the availability of some of the materials and found that some of them were not available. Also, there was no rechargeable option available, so they decided to use the standard double A and triple A batteries, which they thought were a bit bulky and bulky at the same time, and they thought that the dynamo charging would be a bit silly because it was not very resistant to dropping.
The new remote would have a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. It would be made of plastic and spongy and would be in a different colour. There would be a G-U-I-I interface in the middle of the flip-top and there would be some sort of touch screen on the buttons. The remote would be able to have a lot of standard buttons and it would be easy to find.
The group decided to check into the financial feasibility of incorporating the feature of finding the remote control by voice recognition. It would be a cool feature to have and it would be technologically innovative also. The group also decided to incorporate the company logo in the design. They would use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover and the case would be made of rubber.
This was the first meeting to generate some ideas about the product design of the new remote control project. Project Manager introduced the project plan and the team members got acquainted with each other and the tools they were going to use during the meetings. Industrial Designer gave a presentation about the technical implemen implications of the remote control. User Interface and User Interface gave presentations about the functional design, the conceptual design and the detailed design, respectively. Then, Project Manager gave a brief overview of the market research and the target market of the product. The team discussed how the product should be original, trendy and user-friendly, and how it should be compatible with different devices. They also discussed the cost limitation of infrared and Bluetooth.
User Interface suggested that the remote control should be a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store. Industrial Designer suggested that it should be able to change the state of the TV by pressing the button. User Interface also suggested that infrared and Bluetooth could be used to communicate with each other. Project Manager suggested that they should think about the way how these things should communicate with other devices.
User Interface thought that the technical function of the remote control was to change the state of the TV by pressing the button, which was just the basic technical function. There should be no other controls, such as a touch-screen or infrared, because they were too vulnerable to be used by a user to switch between channels or change between tracks on a CD player or DVD player.
Industrial Designer thought that a modern remote control should control a diverse subset of equipment, for instance, D-V-D players, cell phones, video and audio equipment, so one remote control for all kinds of devices should be possible. In addition, he thought that infrared was not hot technical stuff anymore, so they should think about the things like Bluetooth.
Industrial Designer thought infrared was not really hot technical stuff anymore, so infrared should be restricted to the range. User Interface suggested that they could equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote. Project Manager agreed.
Industrial Designer suggested that infrared was not hot technical stuff anymore, so they should think about the things like Bluetooth. Also, infrared should not be used all the time, so infrared should be restricted to that. User Interface suggested that they could equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote.
User Interface thought that Bluetooth was old-fashioned and expensive. All the TVs were equipped with infrared, so it would not be cost-effective to use Bluetooth all the time. Also, it would be inconvenient to change the batteries every other week, so infrared should not consume too much power.
